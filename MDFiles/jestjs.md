# File Summary

## Purpose
This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase [Jest], containing specifically included files, combined into a single document. This markdown document serves as a compact, self-contained reference guide for [Jest], derived from its official documentation and repository. It is designed for users who may have no prior knowledge, partial familiarity, or limited practical experience with the technology. The primary goal is to enable efficient use of AI systems (such as LLMs) for tasks like code review, debugging, analysis, code generation, and other automated processes, without requiring users to navigate the full documentation.

When this document is provided to an AI system, it should be treated as the primary knowledge base for all related queries. As an AI, follow these guidelines unless explicitly overridden by user instructions:
  Code Review and Analysis: Examine user-submitted code for correctness, best practices, and potential improvements based on the content in this document.
  Debugging: Identify and suggest fixes for errors by referencing documented common issues, error messages, and solutions.
  Code Writing: Generate code snippets, examples, or implementations that adhere to the technology's APIs, conventions, and best practices outlined here.
  General Assistance: Provide clear explanations, tutorials, or answers to questions using only the information in this document, ensuring responses are accurate, concise, and relevant.
  Scope Limitations: If a query cannot be addressed with the available content, politely inform the user and recommend consulting the official documentation for additional details.
  This approach streamlines development workflows by allowing users to issue targeted prompts (e.g., "Review this code for [Jest]" or "Debug this error") directly based on this reference, saving time and reducing the learning curve.

## Additional Info
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

title: Bypassing module mocks
---

Jest allows you to mock out whole modules in your tests, which can be useful for testing if your code is calling functions from that module correctly. However, sometimes you may want to use parts of a mocked module in your _test file_, in which case you want to access the original implementation, rather than a mocked version.

Consider writing a test case for this `createUser` function:

```javascript title="createUser.js"
import fetch from "node-fetch";

export const createUser = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://website.com/users", { method: "POST" });
  const userId = await response.text();
  return userId;
};
```

Your test will want to mock the `fetch` function so that we can be sure that it gets called without actually making the network request. However, you'll also need to mock the return value of `fetch` with a `Response` (wrapped in a `Promise`), as our function uses it to grab the created user's ID. So you might initially try writing a test like this:

```javascript
jest.mock("node-fetch");

import fetch, { Response } from "node-fetch";
import { createUser } from "./createUser";

test("createUser calls fetch with the right args and returns the user id", async () => {
  fetch.mockReturnValue(Promise.resolve(new Response("4")));

  const userId = await createUser();

  expect(fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  expect(fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith("https://website.com/users", {
    method: "POST",
  });
  expect(userId).toBe("4");
});
```

However, if you ran that test you would find that the `createUser` function would fail, throwing the error: `TypeError: response.text is not a function`. This is because the `Response` class you've imported from `node-fetch` has been mocked (due to the `jest.mock` call at the top of the test file) so it no longer behaves the way it should.

To get around problems like this, Jest provides the `jest.requireActual` helper. To make the above test work, make the following change to the imports in the test file:

```javascript
// BEFORE
jest.mock("node-fetch");
import fetch, { Response } from "node-fetch";
```

```javascript
// AFTER
jest.mock("node-fetch");
import fetch from "node-fetch";
const { Response } = jest.requireActual("node-fetch");
```

This allows your test file to import the actual `Response` object from `node-fetch`, rather than a mocked version. This means the test will now pass correctly.

id: cli
title: Jest CLI Options
---

The `jest` command line runner has a number of useful options. You can run `jest --help` to view all available options. Many of the options shown below can also be used together to run tests exactly the way you want. Every one of Jest's [Configuration](Configuration.md) options can also be specified through the CLI.

Here is a brief overview:

## Running from the command line

Run all tests (default):

```bash
jest
```

Run only the tests that were specified with a pattern or filename:

```bash
jest my-test #or
jest path/to/my-test.js
```

Run tests related to changed files based on hg/git (uncommitted files):

```bash
jest -o
```

Run tests related to `path/to/fileA.js` and `path/to/fileB.js`:

```bash
jest --findRelatedTests path/to/fileA.js path/to/fileB.js
```

Run tests that match this spec name (match against the name in `describe` or `test`, basically).

```bash
jest -t name-of-spec
```

Run watch mode:

```bash
jest --watch #runs jest -o by default
jest --watchAll #runs all tests
```

Watch mode also enables to specify the name or path to a file to focus on a specific set of tests.

## Using with package manager

If you run Jest via your package manager, you can still pass the command line arguments directly as Jest arguments.

Instead of:

```bash
jest -u -t="ColorPicker"
```

you can use:

```bash npm2yarn
npm test -- -u -t="ColorPicker"
```

## Camelcase & dashed args support

Jest supports both camelcase and dashed arg formats. The following examples will have an equal result:

```bash
jest --collect-coverage
jest --collectCoverage
```

Arguments can also be mixed:

```bash
jest --update-snapshot --detectOpenHandles
```

## Options

:::note

CLI options take precedence over values from the [Configuration](Configuration.md).

## Reference

### `jest <regexForTestFiles>`

When you run `jest` with an argument, that argument is treated as a regular expression to match against files in your project. It is possible to run test suites by providing a pattern. Only the files that the pattern matches will be picked up and executed. Depending on your terminal, you may need to quote this argument: `jest "my.*(complex)?pattern"`. On Windows, you will need to use `/` as a path separator or escape `\` as `\\`.

### `--bail[=<n>]`

Alias: `-b`. Exit the test suite immediately upon `n` number of failing test suite. Defaults to `1`.

### `--cache`

Whether to use the cache. Defaults to true. Disable the cache using `--no-cache`.

:::caution

The cache should only be disabled if you are experiencing caching related problems. On average, disabling the cache makes Jest at least two times slower.

:::

If you want to inspect the cache, use `--showConfig` and look at the `cacheDirectory` value. If you need to clear the cache, use `--clearCache`.

### `--changedFilesWithAncestor`

Runs tests related to the current changes and the changes made in the last commit. Behaves similarly to `--onlyChanged`.

### `--changedSince`

Runs tests related to the changes since the provided branch or commit hash. If the current branch has diverged from the given branch, then only changes made locally will be tested. Behaves similarly to `--onlyChanged`.

### `--ci`

When this option is provided, Jest will assume it is running in a CI environment. This changes the behavior when a new snapshot is encountered. Instead of the regular behavior of storing a new snapshot automatically, it will fail the test and require Jest to be run with `--updateSnapshot`.

### `--clearCache`

Deletes the Jest cache directory and then exits without running tests. Will delete `cacheDirectory` if the option is passed, or Jest's default cache directory. The default cache directory can be found by calling `jest --showConfig`.

:::caution

Clearing the cache will reduce performance.

:::

### `--clearMocks`

Automatically clear mock calls, instances, contexts and results before every test. Equivalent to calling [`jest.clearAllMocks()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestclearallmocks) before each test. This does not remove any mock implementation that may have been provided.

### `--collectCoverageFrom=<glob>`

A glob pattern relative to `rootDir` matching the files that coverage info needs to be collected from.

### `--colors`

Forces test results output highlighting even if stdout is not a TTY.

:::note

Alternatively you can set the environment variable `FORCE_COLOR=true` to forcefully enable or `FORCE_COLOR=false` to disable colorized output. The use of `FORCE_COLOR` overrides all other color support checks.

:::

### `--config=<path>`

Alias: `-c`. The path to a Jest config file specifying how to find and execute tests. If no `rootDir` is set in the config, the directory containing the config file is assumed to be the `rootDir` for the project. This can also be a JSON-encoded value which Jest will use as configuration.

### `--coverage[=<boolean>]`

Alias: `--collectCoverage`. Indicates that test coverage information should be collected and reported in the output. Optionally pass `<boolean>` to override option set in configuration.

### `--coverageDirectory=<path>`

The directory where Jest should output its coverage files.

### `--coverageProvider=<provider>`

Indicates which provider should be used to instrument code for coverage. Allowed values are `babel` (default) or `v8`.

### `--debug`

Print debugging info about your Jest config.

### `--detectOpenHandles`

Attempt to collect and print open handles preventing Jest from exiting cleanly. Use this in cases where you need to use `--forceExit` in order for Jest to exit to potentially track down the reason. This implies `--runInBand`, making tests run serially. Implemented using [`async_hooks`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html). This option has a significant performance penalty and should only be used for debugging.

### `--env=<environment>`

The test environment used for all tests. This can point to any file or node module. Examples: `jsdom`, `node` or `path/to/my-environment.js`.

### `--errorOnDeprecated`

Make calling deprecated APIs throw helpful error messages. Useful for easing the upgrade process.

### `--expand`

Alias: `-e`. Use this flag to show full diffs and errors instead of a patch.

### `--filter=<file>`

Path to a module exporting a filtering function. This asynchronous function receives a list of test paths which can be manipulated to exclude tests from running and must return an object with shape `{ filtered: Array<string> }` containing the tests that should be run by Jest. Especially useful when used in conjunction with a testing infrastructure to filter known broken tests.

```js title="my-filter.js"
// This filter when applied will only run tests ending in .spec.js (not the best way to do it, but it's just an example):
const filteringFunction = (testPath) => testPath.endsWith(".spec.js");

module.exports = (testPaths) => {
  const allowedPaths = testPaths.filter(filteringFunction); // ["path1.spec.js", "path2.spec.js", etc]

  return {
    filtered: allowedPaths,
  };
};
```

### `--findRelatedTests <spaceSeparatedListOfSourceFiles>`

Find and run the tests that cover a space separated list of source files that were passed in as arguments. Useful for pre-commit hook integration to run the minimal amount of tests necessary. Can be used together with `--coverage` to include a test coverage for the source files, no duplicate `--collectCoverageFrom` arguments needed.

### `--forceExit`

Force Jest to exit after all tests have completed running. This is useful when resources set up by test code cannot be adequately cleaned up.

:::caution

This feature is an escape-hatch. If Jest doesn't exit at the end of a test run, it means external resources are still being held on to or timers are still pending in your code. It is advised to tear down external resources after each test to make sure Jest can shut down cleanly. You can use `--detectOpenHandles` to help track it down.

:::

### `--help`

Show the help information, similar to this page.

### `--ignoreProjects <project1> ... <projectN>`

Ignore the tests of the specified projects. Jest uses the attribute `displayName` in the configuration to identify each project. If you use this option, you should provide a `displayName` to all your projects.

### `--injectGlobals`

Insert Jest's globals (`expect`, `test`, `describe`, `beforeEach` etc.) into the global environment. If you set this to `false`, you should import from `@jest/globals`, e.g.

```ts
import { expect, jest, test } from "@jest/globals";

jest.useFakeTimers();

test("some test", () => {
  expect(Date.now()).toBe(0);
});
```

:::note

This option is only supported using the default `jest-circus` test runner.

:::

### `--json`

Prints the test results in JSON. This mode will send all other test output and user messages to stderr.

### `--lastCommit`

Run all tests affected by file changes in the last commit made. Behaves similarly to `--onlyChanged`.

### `--listTests`

Lists all test files that Jest will run given the arguments, and exits.

### `--logHeapUsage`

Logs the heap usage after every test. Useful to debug memory leaks. Use together with `--runInBand` and `--expose-gc` in node.

### `--maxConcurrency=<num>`

Prevents Jest from executing more than the specified amount of tests at the same time. Only affects tests that use `test.concurrent`.

### `--maxWorkers=<num>|<string>`

Alias: `-w`. Specifies the maximum number of workers the worker-pool will spawn for running tests. In single run mode, this defaults to the number of the cores available on your machine minus one for the main thread. In watch mode, this defaults to half of the available cores on your machine to ensure Jest is unobtrusive and does not grind your machine to a halt. It may be useful to adjust this in resource limited environments like CIs but the defaults should be adequate for most use-cases.

For environments with variable CPUs available, you can use percentage based configuration: `--maxWorkers=50%`

### `--noStackTrace`

Disables stack trace in test results output.

### `--notify`

Activates notifications for test results. Good for when you don't want your consciousness to be able to focus on anything except JavaScript testing.

### `--onlyChanged`

Alias: `-o`. Attempts to identify which tests to run based on which files have changed in the current repository. Only works if you're running tests in a git/hg repository at the moment and requires a static dependency graph (ie. no dynamic requires).

### `--onlyFailures`

Alias: `-f`. Run tests that failed in the previous execution.

### `--openHandlesTimeout=<milliseconds>`

When `--detectOpenHandles` and `--forceExit` are _disabled_, Jest will print a warning if the process has not exited cleanly after this number of milliseconds. A value of `0` disables the warning. Defaults to `1000`.

### `--outputFile=<filename>`

Write test results to a file when the `--json` option is also specified. The returned JSON structure is documented in [testResultsProcessor](Configuration.md#testresultsprocessor-string).

### `--passWithNoTests`

Allows the test suite to pass when no files are found.

### `--projects <path1> ... <pathN>`

Run tests from one or more projects, found in the specified paths; also takes path globs. This option is the CLI equivalent of the [`projects`](configuration#projects-arraystring--projectconfig) configuration option.

:::note

If configuration files are found in the specified paths, _all_ projects specified within those configuration files will be run.

:::

### `--randomize`

Shuffle the order of the tests within a file. The shuffling is based on the seed. See [`--seed=<num>`](#--seednum) for more info.

Seed value is displayed when this option is set. Equivalent to setting the CLI option [`--showSeed`](#--showseed).

```bash
jest --randomize --seed 1234
```

:::note

This option is only supported using the default `jest-circus` test runner.

:::

### `--reporters`

Run tests with specified reporters. [Reporter options](configuration#reporters-arraymodulename--modulename-options) are not available via CLI. Example with multiple reporters:

`jest --reporters="default" --reporters="jest-junit"`

### `--resetMocks`

Automatically reset mock state before every test. Equivalent to calling [`jest.resetAllMocks()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestresetallmocks) before each test. This will lead to any mocks having their fake implementations removed but does not restore their initial implementation.

### `--restoreMocks`

Automatically restore mock state and implementation before every test. Equivalent to calling [`jest.restoreAllMocks()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestrestoreallmocks) before each test. This will lead to any mocks having their fake implementations removed and restores their initial implementation.

### `--roots`

A list of paths to directories that Jest should use to search for files in.

### `--runInBand`

Alias: `-i`. Run all tests serially in the current process, rather than creating a worker pool of child processes that run tests. This can be useful for debugging.

### `--runTestsByPath`

Run only the tests that were specified with their exact paths. This avoids converting them into a regular expression and matching it against every single file.

For example, given the following file structure:

```bash
__tests__
└── t1.test.js # test
└── t2.test.js # test
```

When ran with a pattern, no test is found:

```bash
jest --runTestsByPath __tests__/t
```

Output:

```bash
No tests found
```

However, passing an exact path will execute only the given test:

```bash
jest --runTestsByPath __tests__/t1.test.js
```

Output:

```bash
PASS __tests__/t1.test.js
```

:::tip

The default regex matching works fine on small runs, but becomes slow if provided with multiple patterns and/or against a lot of tests. This option replaces the regex matching logic and by that optimizes the time it takes Jest to filter specific test files.

:::

### `--seed=<num>`

Sets a seed value that can be retrieved in a test file via [`jest.getSeed()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestgetseed). The seed value must be between `-0x80000000` and `0x7fffffff` inclusive (`-2147483648` (`-(2 ** 31)`) and `2147483647` (`2 ** 31 - 1`) in decimal).

```bash
jest --seed=1324
```

:::tip

If this option is not specified Jest will randomly generate the value. You can use the [`--showSeed`](#--showseed) flag to print the seed in the test report summary.

Jest uses the seed internally for shuffling the order in which test suites are run. If the [`--randomize`](#--randomize) option is used, the seed is also used for shuffling the order of tests within each `describe` block. When dealing with flaky tests, rerunning with the same seed might help reproduce the failure.

:::

### `--selectProjects <project1> ... <projectN>`

Run the tests of the specified projects. Jest uses the attribute `displayName` in the configuration to identify each project. If you use this option, you should provide a `displayName` to all your projects.

### `--setupFilesAfterEnv <path1> ... <pathN>`

A list of paths to modules that run some code to configure or to set up the testing framework before each test. Beware that files imported by the setup scripts will not be mocked during testing.

### `--shard`

The test suite shard to execute in a format of `(?<shardIndex>\d+)/(?<shardCount>\d+)`.

`shardIndex` describes which shard to select while `shardCount` controls the number of shards the suite should be split into.

`shardIndex` and `shardCount` have to be 1-based, positive numbers, and `shardIndex` has to be lower than or equal to `shardCount`.

When `shard` is specified the configured [`testSequencer`](Configuration.md#testsequencer-string) has to implement a `shard` method.

For example, to split the suite into three shards, each running one third of the tests:

```
jest --shard=1/3
jest --shard=2/3
jest --shard=3/3
```

### `--showConfig`

Print your Jest config and then exits.

### `--showSeed`

Prints the seed value in the test report summary. See [`--seed=<num>`](#--seednum) for the details.

Can also be set in configuration. See [`showSeed`](Configuration.md#showseed-boolean).

### `--silent`

Prevent tests from printing messages through the console.

### `--testEnvironmentOptions=<json string>`

A JSON string with options that will be passed to the `testEnvironment`. The relevant options depend on the environment.

### `--testLocationInResults`

Adds a `location` field to test results. Useful if you want to report the location of a test in a reporter.

:::note

In the resulting object `column` is 0-indexed while `line` is not.

```json
{
  "column": 4,
  "line": 5
}
```

:::

### `--testMatch glob1 ... globN`

The glob patterns Jest uses to detect test files. Please refer to the [`testMatch` configuration](Configuration.md#testmatch-arraystring) for details.

### `--testNamePattern=<regex>`

Alias: `-t`. Run only tests with a name that matches the regex. For example, suppose you want to run only tests related to authorization which will have names like `'GET /api/posts with auth'`, then you can use `jest -t=auth`.

:::tip

The regex is matched against the full name, which is a combination of the test name and all its surrounding describe blocks.

:::

### `--testPathIgnorePatterns=<regex>|[array]`

A single or array of regexp pattern strings that are tested against all tests paths before executing the test. Contrary to `--testPathPatterns`, it will only run those tests with a path that does not match with the provided regexp expressions.

To pass as an array use escaped parentheses and space delimited regexps such as `\(/node_modules/ /tests/e2e/\)`. Alternatively, you can omit parentheses by combining regexps into a single regexp like `/node_modules/|/tests/e2e/`. These two examples are equivalent.

### `--testPathPatterns=<regex>`

A regexp pattern string that is matched against all tests paths before executing the test. On Windows, you will need to use `/` as a path separator or escape `\` as `\\`.

### `--testRunner=<path>`

Lets you specify a custom test runner.

### `--testSequencer=<path>`

Lets you specify a custom test sequencer. Please refer to the [`testSequencer` configuration](Configuration.md#testsequencer-string) for details.

### `--testTimeout=<number>`

Default timeout of a test in milliseconds. Default value: 5000.

### `--updateSnapshot`

Alias: `-u`. Use this flag to re-record every snapshot that fails during this test run. Can be used together with a test suite pattern or with `--testNamePattern` to re-record snapshots.

### `--useStderr`

Divert all output to stderr.

### `--verbose`

Display individual test results with the test suite hierarchy.

### `--version`

Alias: `-v`. Print the version and exit.

### `--waitNextEventLoopTurnForUnhandledRejectionEvents`

Gives one event loop turn to handle `rejectionHandled`, `uncaughtException` or `unhandledRejection`.

Without this flag Jest may report false-positive errors (e.g. actually handled rejection reported) or not report actually unhandled rejection (or report it for different test case).

This option may add a noticeable overhead for fast test suites.

### `--watch`

Watch files for changes and rerun tests related to changed files. If you want to re-run all tests when a file has changed, use the `--watchAll` option instead.

:::tip

Use `--no-watch` (or `--watch=false`) to explicitly disable the watch mode if it was enabled using `--watch`. In most CI environments, this is automatically handled for you.

:::

### `--watchAll`

Watch files for changes and rerun all tests when something changes. If you want to re-run only the tests that depend on the changed files, use the `--watch` option.

:::tip

Use `--no-watchAll` (or `--watchAll=false`) to explicitly disable the watch mode if it was enabled using `--watchAll`. In most CI environments, this is automatically handled for you.

:::

### `--watchman`

Whether to use [`watchman`](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) for file crawling. Defaults to `true`. Disable using `--no-watchman`.

### `--workerThreads`

Whether to use [worker threads](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/worker_threads.html) for parallelization. [Child processes](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/child_process.html) are used by default.

:::caution

This is **experimental feature**. See the [`workerThreads` configuration option](Configuration.md#workerthreads) for more details.

## File: docs/CodeTransformation.md

id: code-transformation
title: Code Transformation
---

Jest runs the code in your project as JavaScript, but if you use some syntax not supported by Node out of the box (such as JSX, TypeScript, Vue templates) then you'll need to transform that code into plain JavaScript, similar to what you would do when building for browsers.

Jest supports this via the [`transform`](Configuration.md#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object) configuration option.

A transformer is a module that provides a method for transforming source files. For example, if you wanted to be able to use a new language feature in your modules or tests that aren't yet supported by Node, you might plug in a code preprocessor that would transpile a future version of JavaScript to a current one.

Jest will cache the result of a transformation and attempt to invalidate that result based on a number of factors, such as the source of the file being transformed and changing configuration.

## Defaults

Jest ships with one transformer out of the box &ndash; [`babel-jest`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/babel-jest#setup). It will load your project's Babel configuration and transform any file matching the `/\.[jt]sx?$/` RegExp (in other words, any `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts` or `.tsx` file). In addition, `babel-jest` will inject the Babel plugin necessary for mock hoisting talked about in [ES Module mocking](ManualMocks.md#using-with-es-module-imports).

:::note

By default, `babel-jest` includes `babel-preset-jest`. You can disable this behavior by specifying `excludeJestPreset: true` to `babel-jest`. Note that this will also stop hoisting `jest.mock`, which may break your tests.

```json
"transform": {
  "\\.[jt]sx?$": ["babel-jest", { "excludeJestPreset": true }],
}
```

:::

:::tip

Remember to include the default `babel-jest` transformer explicitly, if you wish to use it alongside with additional code preprocessors:

```json
"transform": {
  "\\.[jt]sx?$": "babel-jest",
  "\\.css$": "some-css-transformer",
}
```

:::

## Writing custom transformers

You can write your own transformer. The API of a transformer is as follows:

```ts
interface TransformOptions<TransformerConfig = unknown> {
  supportsDynamicImport: boolean;
  supportsExportNamespaceFrom: boolean;
  /**
   * The value is:
   * - `false` if Jest runs without Node ESM flag `--experimental-vm-modules`
   * - `true` if the file extension is defined in [extensionsToTreatAsEsm](Configuration.md#extensionstotreatasesm-arraystring)
   * and Jest runs with Node ESM flag `--experimental-vm-modules`
   *
   * See more at https://jestjs.io/docs/next/ecmascript-modules
   */
  supportsStaticESM: boolean;
  supportsTopLevelAwait: boolean;
  instrument: boolean;
  /** Cached file system which is used by `jest-runtime` to improve performance. */
  cacheFS: Map<string, string>;
  /** Jest configuration of currently running project. */
  config: ProjectConfig;
  /** Stringified version of the `config` - useful in cache busting. */
  configString: string;
  /** Transformer configuration passed through `transform` option by the user. */
  transformerConfig: TransformerConfig;
}

type TransformedSource = {
  code: string;
  map?: RawSourceMap | string | null;
};

interface SyncTransformer<TransformerConfig = unknown> {
  canInstrument?: boolean;

  getCacheKey?: (
    sourceText: string,
    sourcePath: string,
    options: TransformOptions<TransformerConfig>
  ) => string;

  getCacheKeyAsync?: (
    sourceText: string,
    sourcePath: string,
    options: TransformOptions<TransformerConfig>
  ) => Promise<string>;

  process: (

:::note

The definitions above were trimmed down for brevity. Full code can be found in [Jest repo on GitHub](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/packages/jest-transform/src/types.ts) (remember to choose the right tag/commit for your version of Jest).

:::

There are a couple of ways you can import code into Jest - using Common JS (`require`) or ECMAScript Modules (`import` - which exists in static and dynamic versions). Jest passes files through code transformation on demand (for instance when a `require` or `import` is evaluated). This process, also known as "transpilation", might happen _synchronously_ (in the case of `require`), or _asynchronously_ (in the case of `import` or `import()`, the latter of which also works from Common JS modules). For this reason, the interface exposes both pairs of methods for asynchronous and synchronous processes: `process{Async}` and `getCacheKey{Async}`. The latter is called to figure out if we need to call `process{Async}` at all.

Asynchronous transpilation can fall back to the synchronous `process` call if `processAsync` is unimplemented, but synchronous transpilation cannot use the asynchronous `processAsync` call. If your codebase is ESM only, implementing the async variants are sufficient. Otherwise, if any code is loaded through `require` (including `createRequire` from within ESM), then you need to implement the synchronous `process` variant.

Be aware that `node_modules` is not transpiled with default config, the `transformIgnorePatterns` setting must be modified in order to do so.

Semi-related to this are the supports flags we pass (see `CallerTransformOptions` above), but those should be used within the transform to figure out if it should return ESM or CJS, and has no direct bearing on sync vs async

Though not required, we _highly recommend_ implementing `getCacheKey` as well, so we do not waste resources transpiling when we could have read its previous result from disk. You can use [`@jest/create-cache-key-function`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jest/create-cache-key-function) to help implement it.

Instead of having your custom transformer implement the `Transformer` interface directly, you can choose to export `createTransformer`, a factory function to dynamically create transformers. This is to allow having a transformer config in your jest config.

:::note

[ECMAScript module](ECMAScriptModules.md) support is indicated by the passed in `supports*` options. Specifically `supportsDynamicImport: true` means the transformer can return `import()` expressions, which is supported by both ESM and CJS. If `supportsStaticESM: true` it means top level `import` statements are supported and the code will be interpreted as ESM and not CJS. See [Node's docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_differences_between_es_modules_and_commonjs) for details on the differences.

:::

:::tip

Make sure `process{Async}` method returns source map alongside with transformed code, so it is possible to report line information accurately in code coverage and test errors. Inline source maps also work but are slower.

During the development of a transformer it can be useful to run Jest with `--no-cache` to frequently [delete cache](Troubleshooting.md#caching-issues).

:::

### Examples

### TypeScript with type checking

While `babel-jest` by default will transpile TypeScript files, Babel will not verify the types. If you want that you can use [`ts-jest`](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest).

#### Transforming images to their path

Importing images is a way to include them in your browser bundle, but they are not valid JavaScript. One way of handling it in Jest is to replace the imported value with its filename.

```js title="fileTransformer.js"
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  process(sourceText, sourcePath, options) {
    return {
      code: `module.exports = ${JSON.stringify(path.basename(sourcePath))};`,
    };
  },
};
```

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  transform: {
    "\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|eot|otf|webp|svg|ttf|woff|woff2|mp4|webm|wav|mp3|m4a|aac|oga)$":
      "<rootDir>/fileTransformer.js",
  },
};
```

title: Configuring Jest
---

The Jest philosophy is to work great by default, but sometimes you just need more configuration power.

It is recommended to define the configuration in a dedicated JavaScript, TypeScript or JSON file. The file will be discovered automatically, if it is named `jest.config.js|ts|mjs|cjs|cts|json`. You can use [`--config`](CLI.md#--configpath) flag to pass an explicit path to the file.

:::note

Keep in mind that the resulting configuration object must always be JSON-serializable.

:::

The configuration file should simply export an object:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  verbose: true,
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  verbose: true,
};

export default config;
```

Or a function returning an object:

```js tab
/** @returns {Promise<import('jest').Config>} */
module.exports = async () => {
  return {
    verbose: true,
  };
};
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

export default async (): Promise<Config> => {
  return {
    verbose: true,
  };
};
```

:::tip

To read TypeScript configuration files Jest by default requires [`ts-node`](https://npmjs.com/package/ts-node). You can override this behavior by adding a `@jest-config-loader` docblock at the top of the file. Currently, [`ts-node`](https://npmjs.com/package/ts-node) and [`esbuild-register`](https://npmjs.com/package/esbuild-register) is supported. Make sure `ts-node` or the loader you specify is installed.

```ts title="jest.config.ts"
/** @jest-config-loader ts-node */
// or
/** @jest-config-loader esbuild-register */

import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  verbose: true,
};

export default config;
```

You can also pass options to the loader, for instance to enable `transpileOnly`.

```ts title="jest.config.ts"
/** @jest-config-loader ts-node */
/** @jest-config-loader-options {"transpileOnly": true} */

import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  verbose: true,
};

export default config;
```

:::

The configuration also can be stored in a JSON file as a plain object:

```json title="jest.config.json"
{
  "bail": 1,
  "verbose": true
}
```

Alternatively Jest's configuration can be defined through the `"jest"` key in the `package.json` of your project:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "jest": {
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

Also Jest's configuration json file can be referenced through the `"jest"` key in the `package.json` of your project:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "jest": "./path/to/config.json"
}
```

## Options

:::info

You can retrieve Jest's defaults from `jest-config` to extend them if needed:

```js tab
const { defaults } = require("jest-config");

/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  moduleDirectories: [...defaults.moduleDirectories, "bower_components"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";
import { defaults } from "jest-config";

const config: Config = {
  moduleDirectories: [...defaults.moduleDirectories, "bower_components"],
};

export default config;
```

import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

<TOCInline toc={toc.slice(2)} />

## Reference

### `automock` \[boolean]

Default: `false`

This option tells Jest that all imported modules in your tests should be mocked automatically. All modules used in your tests will have a replacement implementation, keeping the API surface.

Example:

```js title="utils.js"
export default {
  authorize: () => "token",
  isAuthorized: (secret) => secret === "wizard",
};
```

```js title="__tests__/automock.test.js"
import utils from "../utils";

test("if utils mocked automatically", () => {
  // Public methods of `utils` are now mock functions
  expect(utils.authorize.mock).toBeTruthy();
  expect(utils.isAuthorized.mock).toBeTruthy();

  // You can provide them with your own implementation
  // or pass the expected return value
  utils.authorize.mockReturnValue("mocked_token");
  utils.isAuthorized.mockReturnValue(true);

  expect(utils.authorize()).toBe("mocked_token");
  expect(utils.isAuthorized("not_wizard")).toBeTruthy();
});
```

:::note

Node modules are automatically mocked when you have a manual mock in place (e.g.: `__mocks__/lodash.js`). More info [here](ManualMocks.md#mocking-node-modules).

Node.js core modules, like `fs`, are not mocked by default. They can be mocked explicitly, like `jest.mock('fs')`.

:::

### `bail` \[number | boolean]

Default: `0`

By default, Jest runs all tests and produces all errors into the console upon completion. The bail config option can be used here to have Jest stop running tests after `n` failures. Setting bail to `true` is the same as setting bail to `1`.

### `cacheDirectory` \[string]

Default: `"/tmp/<path>"`

The directory where Jest should store its cached dependency information.

Jest attempts to scan your dependency tree once (up-front) and cache it in order to ease some of the filesystem churn that needs to happen while running tests. This config option lets you customize where Jest stores that cache data on disk.

### `clearMocks` \[boolean]

Default: `false`

Automatically clear mock calls, instances, contexts and results before every test. Equivalent to calling [`jest.clearAllMocks()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestclearallmocks) before each test. This does not remove any mock implementation that may have been provided.

### `collectCoverage` \[boolean]

Default: `false`

Indicates whether the coverage information should be collected while executing the test. Because this retrofits all executed files with coverage collection statements, it may significantly slow down your tests.

Jest ships with two coverage providers: `babel` (default) and `v8`. See the [`coverageProvider`](#coverageprovider-string) option for more details.

:::info

The `babel` and `v8` coverage providers use `/* istanbul ignore next */` and `/* c8 ignore next */` comments to exclude lines from coverage reports, respectively. For more information, you can view the [`istanbuljs` documentation](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc#parsing-hints-ignoring-lines) and the [`c8` documentation](https://github.com/bcoe/c8#ignoring-uncovered-lines-functions-and-blocks).

:::

### `collectCoverageFrom` \[array]

Default: `undefined`

An array of [glob patterns](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) indicating a set of files for which coverage information should be collected. If a file matches the specified glob pattern, coverage information will be collected for it even if no tests exist for this file and it's never required in the test suite.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    "**/*.{js,jsx}",
    "!**/node_modules/**",
    "!**/vendor/**",
  ],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    "**/*.{js,jsx}",
    "!**/node_modules/**",
    "!**/vendor/**",
  ],
};

export default config;
```

This will collect coverage information for all the files inside the project's `rootDir`, except the ones that match `**/node_modules/**` or `**/vendor/**`.

:::tip

Each glob pattern is applied in the order they are specified in the config. For example `["!**/__tests__/**", "**/*.js"]` will not exclude `__tests__` because the negation is overwritten with the second pattern. In order to make the negated glob work in this example it has to come after `**/*.js`.

:::

:::note

This option requires `collectCoverage` to be set to `true` or Jest to be invoked with `--coverage`.

:::

<details>
  <summary>Help:</summary>

If you are seeing coverage output such as...

```
=============================== Coverage summary ===============================
Statements   : Unknown% ( 0/0 )

Jest: Coverage data for global was not found.
```

Most likely your glob patterns are not matching any files. Refer to the [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) documentation to ensure your globs are compatible.

</details>

### `coverageDirectory` \[string]

Default: `undefined`

The directory where Jest should output its coverage files.

### `coveragePathIgnorePatterns` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `["/node_modules/"]`

An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all file paths before executing the test. If the file path matches any of the patterns, coverage information will be skipped.

These pattern strings match against the full path. Use the `<rootDir>` string token to include the path to your project's root directory to prevent it from accidentally ignoring all of your files in different environments that may have different root directories. Example: `["<rootDir>/build/", "<rootDir>/node_modules/"]`.

### `coverageProvider` \[string]

Indicates which provider should be used to instrument code for coverage. Allowed values are `babel` (default) or `v8`.

### `coverageReporters` \[array&lt;string | \[string, options]&gt;]

Default: `["clover", "json", "lcov", "text"]`

A list of reporter names that Jest uses when writing coverage reports. Any [istanbul reporter](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/tree/master/packages/istanbul-reports/lib) can be used.

:::tip

Setting this option overwrites the default values. Add `"text"` or `"text-summary"` to see a coverage summary in the console output.

:::

Additional options can be passed using the tuple form. For example, you may hide coverage report lines for all fully-covered files:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  coverageReporters: ["clover", "json", "lcov", ["text", { skipFull: true }]],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  coverageReporters: ["clover", "json", "lcov", ["text", { skipFull: true }]],
};

export default config;
```

For more information about the options object shape refer to `CoverageReporterWithOptions` type in the [type definitions](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/jest-types/src/Config.ts).

### `coverageThreshold` \[object]

Default: `undefined`

This will be used to configure minimum threshold enforcement for coverage results. Thresholds can be specified as `global`, as a [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer), and as a directory or file path. If thresholds aren't met, jest will fail. Thresholds specified as a positive number are taken to be the minimum percentage required. Thresholds specified as a negative number represent the maximum number of uncovered entities allowed.

For example, with the following configuration jest will fail if there is less than 80% branch, line, and function coverage, or if there are more than 10 uncovered statements:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: -10,
    },
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: -10,
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

If globs or paths are specified alongside `global`, coverage data for matching paths will be subtracted from overall coverage and thresholds will be applied independently. Thresholds for globs are applied to all files matching the glob. If the file specified by path is not found, an error is returned.

For example, with the following configuration:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 50,
      functions: 50,
      lines: 50,
      statements: 50,
    },
    "./src/components/": {
      branches: 40,
      statements: 40,
    },
    "./src/reducers/**/*.js": {
      statements: 90,
    },
    "./src/api/very-important-module.js": {
      branches: 100,
      functions: 100,
      lines: 100,
      statements: 100,
    },
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 50,
      functions: 50,
      lines: 50,
      statements: 50,
    },
    "./src/components/": {
      branches: 40,
      statements: 40,
    },
    "./src/reducers/**/*.js": {
      statements: 90,
    },
    "./src/api/very-important-module.js": {
      branches: 100,
      functions: 100,
      lines: 100,
      statements: 100,
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

Jest will fail if:

- The `./src/components` directory has less than 40% branch or statement coverage.
- One of the files matching the `./src/reducers/**/*.js` glob has less than 90% statement coverage.
- The `./src/api/very-important-module.js` file has less than 100% coverage.
- Every remaining file combined has less than 50% coverage (`global`).

### `dependencyExtractor` \[string]

Default: `undefined`

This option allows the use of a custom dependency extractor. It must be a node module that exports an object with an `extract` function. E.g.:

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");
const fs = require("fs");

module.exports = {
  extract(code, filePath, defaultExtract) {
    const deps = defaultExtract(code, filePath);
    // Scan the file and add dependencies in `deps` (which is a `Set`)
    return deps;
  },
  getCacheKey() {
    return crypto
      .createHash("md5")
      .update(fs.readFileSync(__filename))
      .digest("hex");
  },
};
```

The `extract` function should return an iterable (`Array`, `Set`, etc.) with the dependencies found in the code.

That module can also contain a `getCacheKey` function to generate a cache key to determine if the logic has changed and any cached artifacts relying on it should be discarded.

### `displayName` \[string, object]

default: `undefined`

Allows for a label to be printed alongside a test while it is running. This becomes more useful in multi-project repositories where there can be many jest configuration files. This visually tells which project a test belongs to.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  displayName: "CLIENT",
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  displayName: "CLIENT",
};

export default config;
```

Alternatively, an object with the properties `name` and `color` can be passed. This allows for a custom configuration of the background color of the displayName. `displayName` defaults to white when its value is a string. Jest uses [`chalk`](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) to provide the color. As such, all of the valid options for colors supported by `chalk` are also supported by Jest.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  displayName: {
    name: "CLIENT",
    color: "blue",
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  displayName: {
    name: "CLIENT",
    color: "blue",
  },
};

export default config;
```

### `errorOnDeprecated` \[boolean]

Default: `false`

Make calling deprecated APIs throw helpful error messages. Useful for easing the upgrade process.

### `extensionsToTreatAsEsm` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `[]`

Jest will run `.mjs` and `.js` files with nearest `package.json`'s `type` field set to `module` as ECMAScript Modules. If you have any other files that should run with native ESM, you need to specify their file extension here.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  extensionsToTreatAsEsm: [".ts"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  extensionsToTreatAsEsm: [".ts"],
};

export default config;
```

:::caution

Jest's ESM support is still experimental, see [its docs for more details](ECMAScriptModules.md).

:::

### `fakeTimers` \[object]

Default: `{}`

The fake timers may be useful when a piece of code sets a long timeout that we don't want to wait for in a test. For additional details see [Fake Timers guide](TimerMocks.md) and [API documentation](JestObjectAPI.md#fake-timers).

This option provides the default configuration of fake timers for all tests. Calling `jest.useFakeTimers()` in a test file will use these options or will override them if a configuration object is passed. For example, you can tell Jest to keep the original implementation of `process.nextTick()` and adjust the limit of recursive timers that will be run:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  fakeTimers: {
    doNotFake: ["nextTick"],
    timerLimit: 1000,
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  fakeTimers: {
    doNotFake: ["nextTick"],
    timerLimit: 1000,
  },
};

export default config;
```

```js title="fakeTime.test.js"
// install fake timers for this file using the options from Jest configuration
jest.useFakeTimers();

test("increase the limit of recursive timers for this and following tests", () => {
  jest.useFakeTimers({ timerLimit: 5000 });
  // ...
});
```

:::tip

Instead of including `jest.useFakeTimers()` in each test file, you can enable fake timers globally for all tests in your Jest configuration:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  fakeTimers: {
    enableGlobally: true,
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  fakeTimers: {
    enableGlobally: true,
  },
};

export default config;
```

:::

Configuration options:

```ts
type FakeableAPI =
  | "Date"
  | "hrtime"
  | "nextTick"
  | "performance"
  | "queueMicrotask"
  | "requestAnimationFrame"
  | "cancelAnimationFrame"
  | "requestIdleCallback"
  | "cancelIdleCallback"
  | "setImmediate"
  | "clearImmediate"
  | "setInterval"
  | "clearInterval"
  | "setTimeout"
  | "clearTimeout";

type ModernFakeTimersConfig = {
  /**
   * If set to `true` all timers will be advanced automatically by 20 milliseconds
   * every 20 milliseconds. A custom time delta may be provided by passing a number.
   * The default is `false`.
   */
  advanceTimers?: boolean | number;
  /**
   * List of names of APIs that should not be faked. The default is `[]`, meaning
   * all APIs are faked.
   */
  doNotFake?: Array<FakeableAPI>;
  /** Whether fake timers should be enabled for all test files. The default is `false`. */
  enableGlobally?: boolean;
  /**
   * Use the old fake timers implementation instead of one backed by `@sinonjs/fake-timers`.
   * The default is `false`.
   */
  legacyFakeTimers?: boolean;
  /** Sets current system time to be used by fake timers, in milliseconds. The default is `Date.now()`. */
  now?: number;
  /** Maximum number of recursive timers that will be run. The default is `100_000` timers. */
  timerLimit?: number;
};
```

:::info Legacy Fake Timers

For some reason you might have to use legacy implementation of fake timers. Here is how to enable it globally (additional options are not supported):

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  fakeTimers: {
    enableGlobally: true,
    legacyFakeTimers: true,
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  fakeTimers: {
    enableGlobally: true,
    legacyFakeTimers: true,
  },
};

export default config;
```

:::

### `forceCoverageMatch` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `['']`

Test files are normally ignored from collecting code coverage. With this option, you can overwrite this behavior and include otherwise ignored files in code coverage.

For example, if you have tests in source files named with `.t.js` extension as following:

```javascript title="sum.t.js"
export function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "test") {
  test("sum", () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
}
```

You can collect coverage from those files with setting `forceCoverageMatch`.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  forceCoverageMatch: ["**/*.t.js"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  forceCoverageMatch: ["**/*.t.js"],
};

export default config;
```

### `globals` \[object]

Default: `{}`

A set of global variables that need to be available in all test environments.

For example, the following would create a global `__DEV__` variable set to `true` in all test environments:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  globals: {
    __DEV__: true,
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  globals: {
    __DEV__: true,
  },
};

export default config;
```

:::note

If you specify a global reference value (like an object or array) here, and some code mutates that value in the midst of running a test, that mutation will _not_ be persisted across test runs for other test files. In addition, the `globals` object must be json-serializable, so it can't be used to specify global functions. For that, you should use `setupFiles`.

:::

### `globalSetup` \[string]

Default: `undefined`

This option allows the use of a custom global setup module, which must export a function (it can be sync or async). The function will be triggered once before all test suites and it will receive two arguments: Jest's [`globalConfig`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/v29.2.1/packages/jest-types/src/Config.ts#L358-L422) and [`projectConfig`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/v29.2.1/packages/jest-types/src/Config.ts#L424-L481).

:::info

A global setup module configured in a project (using multi-project runner) will be triggered only when you run at least one test from this project.

Any global variables that are defined through `globalSetup` can only be read in `globalTeardown`. You cannot retrieve globals defined here in your test suites.

While code transformation is applied to the linked setup-file, Jest will **not** transform any code in `node_modules`. This is due to the need to load the actual transformers (e.g. `babel` or `typescript`) to perform transformation.

:::

```js title="setup.js"
module.exports = async function (globalConfig, projectConfig) {
  console.log(globalConfig.testPathPatterns);
  console.log(projectConfig.cache);

  // Set reference to mongod in order to close the server during teardown.
  globalThis.__MONGOD__ = mongod;
};
```

```js title="teardown.js"
module.exports = async function (globalConfig, projectConfig) {
  console.log(globalConfig.testPathPatterns);
  console.log(projectConfig.cache);

  await globalThis.__MONGOD__.stop();
};
```

### `globalTeardown` \[string]

Default: `undefined`

This option allows the use of a custom global teardown module which must export a function (it can be sync or async). The function will be triggered once after all test suites and it will receive two arguments: Jest's [`globalConfig`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/v29.2.1/packages/jest-types/src/Config.ts#L358-L422) and [`projectConfig`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/v29.2.1/packages/jest-types/src/Config.ts#L424-L481).

:::info

A global teardown module configured in a project (using multi-project runner) will be triggered only when you run at least one test from this project.

The same caveat concerning transformation of `node_modules` as for `globalSetup` applies to `globalTeardown`.

:::

### `haste` \[object]

Default: `undefined`

This will be used to configure the behavior of `jest-haste-map`, Jest's internal file crawler/cache system. The following options are supported:

```ts
type HasteConfig = {
  /** Whether to hash files using SHA-1. */
  computeSha1?: boolean;
  /** The platform to use as the default, e.g. 'ios'. */
  defaultPlatform?: string | null;
  /** Force use of Node's `fs` APIs rather than shelling out to `find` */
  forceNodeFilesystemAPI?: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether to follow symlinks when crawling for files.
   *   This options cannot be used in projects which use watchman.
   *   Projects with `watchman` set to true will error if this option is set to true.
   */
  enableSymlinks?: boolean;
  /** Path to a custom implementation of Haste. */
  hasteImplModulePath?: string;
  /** All platforms to target, e.g ['ios', 'android']. */
  platforms?: Array<string>;
  /** Whether to throw an error on module collision. */
  throwOnModuleCollision?: boolean;
  /** Custom HasteMap module */
  hasteMapModulePath?: string;
  /** Whether to retain all files, allowing e.g. search for tests in `node_modules`. */
  retainAllFiles?: boolean;
};
```

### `injectGlobals` \[boolean]

Default: `true`

Insert Jest's globals (`expect`, `test`, `describe`, `beforeEach` etc.) into the global environment. If you set this to `false`, you should import from `@jest/globals`, e.g.

```ts
import { expect, jest, test } from "@jest/globals";

jest.useFakeTimers();

test("some test", () => {
  expect(Date.now()).toBe(0);
});
```

:::note

This option is only supported using the default `jest-circus` test runner.

:::

### `maxConcurrency` \[number]

Default: `5`

A number limiting the number of tests that are allowed to run at the same time when using `test.concurrent`. Any test above this limit will be queued and executed once a slot is released.

### `maxWorkers` \[number | string]

Specifies the maximum number of workers the worker-pool will spawn for running tests. In single run mode, this defaults to the number of the cores available on your machine minus one for the main thread. In watch mode, this defaults to half of the available cores on your machine to ensure Jest is unobtrusive and does not grind your machine to a halt. It may be useful to adjust this in resource limited environments like CIs but the defaults should be adequate for most use-cases.

For environments with variable CPUs available, you can use percentage based configuration:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  maxWorkers: "50%",
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  maxWorkers: "50%",
};

export default config;
```

### `moduleDirectories` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `["node_modules"]`

An array of directory names to be searched recursively up from the requiring module's location. Setting this option will _override_ the default, if you wish to still search `node_modules` for packages include it along with any other options:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  moduleDirectories: ["node_modules", "bower_components"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  moduleDirectories: ["node_modules", "bower_components"],
};

export default config;
```

:::caution

It is discouraged to use `'.'` as one of the `moduleDirectories`, because this prevents scoped packages such as `@emotion/react` from accessing packages with the same subdirectory name (`react`). See [this issue](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/issues/10498) for more details. In most cases, it is preferable to use the [moduleNameMapper](#modulenamemapper-objectstring-string--arraystring) configuration instead.

:::

### `moduleFileExtensions` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `["js", "mjs", "cjs", "jsx", "ts", "mts", "cts", "tsx", "json", "node"]`

An array of file extensions your modules use. If you require modules without specifying a file extension, these are the extensions Jest will look for, in left-to-right order.

We recommend placing the extensions most commonly used in your project on the left, so if you are using TypeScript, you may want to consider moving "ts" and/or "tsx" to the beginning of the array.

### `moduleNameMapper` \[object&lt;string, string | array&lt;string>&gt;]

Default: `null`

A map from regular expressions to module names or to arrays of module names that allow to stub out resources, like images or styles with a single module.

Modules that are mapped to an alias are unmocked by default, regardless of whether automocking is enabled or not.

Use `<rootDir>` string token to refer to [`rootDir`](#rootdir-string) value if you want to use file paths.

Additionally, you can substitute captured regex groups using numbered backreferences.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^image![a-zA-Z0-9$_-]+$": "GlobalImageStub",
    "^[./a-zA-Z0-9$_-]+\\.png$": "<rootDir>/RelativeImageStub.js",
    "module_name_(.*)": "<rootDir>/substituted_module_$1.js",
    "assets/(.*)": [
      "<rootDir>/images/$1",
      "<rootDir>/photos/$1",
      "<rootDir>/recipes/$1",
    ],
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^image![a-zA-Z0-9$_-]+$": "GlobalImageStub",
    "^[./a-zA-Z0-9$_-]+\\.png$": "<rootDir>/RelativeImageStub.js",
    "module_name_(.*)": "<rootDir>/substituted_module_$1.js",
    "assets/(.*)": [
      "<rootDir>/images/$1",
      "<rootDir>/photos/$1",
      "<rootDir>/recipes/$1",
    ],
  },
};

export default config;
```

The order in which the mappings are defined matters. Patterns are checked one by one until one fits. The most specific rule should be listed first. This is true for arrays of module names as well.

:::info

If you provide module names without boundaries `^$` it may cause hard to spot errors. E.g. `relay` will replace all modules which contain `relay` as a substring in its name: `relay`, `react-relay` and `graphql-relay` will all be pointed to your stub.

:::

### `modulePathIgnorePatterns` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `[]`

An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all module paths before those paths are to be considered 'visible' to the module loader. If a given module's path matches any of the patterns, it will not be `require()`-able in the test environment.

These pattern strings match against the full path. Use the `<rootDir>` string token to include the path to your project's root directory to prevent it from accidentally ignoring all of your files in different environments that may have different root directories.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  modulePathIgnorePatterns: ["<rootDir>/build/"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  modulePathIgnorePatterns: ["<rootDir>/build/"],
};

export default config;
```

### `modulePaths` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `[]`

An alternative API to setting the `NODE_PATH` env variable, `modulePaths` is an array of absolute paths to additional locations to search when resolving modules. Use the `<rootDir>` string token to include the path to your project's root directory.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  modulePaths: ["<rootDir>/app/"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  modulePaths: ["<rootDir>/app/"],
};

export default config;
```

### `notify` \[boolean]

Default: `false`

Activates native OS notifications for test results. To display the notifications Jest needs [`node-notifier`](https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier) package, which must be installed additionally:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev node-notifier
```

:::tip

On macOS, remember to allow notifications from `terminal-notifier` under System Preferences > Notifications & Focus.

On Windows, `node-notifier` creates a new start menu entry on the first use and not display the notification. Notifications will be properly displayed on subsequent runs.

:::

### `notifyMode` \[string]

Default: `failure-change`

Specifies notification mode. Requires `notify: true`.

#### Modes

- `always`: always send a notification.
- `failure`: send a notification when tests fail.
- `success`: send a notification when tests pass.
- `change`: send a notification when the status changed.
- `success-change`: send a notification when tests pass or once when it fails.
- `failure-change`: send a notification when tests fail or once when it passes.

### `openHandlesTimeout` \[number]

Default: `1000`

Print a warning indicating that there are probable open handles if Jest does not exit cleanly this number of milliseconds after it completes. Use `0` to disable the warning.

### `preset` \[string]

Default: `undefined`

A preset that is used as a base for Jest's configuration. A preset should point to an npm module that has a `jest-preset.json`, `jest-preset.js`, `jest-preset.cjs` or `jest-preset.mjs` file at the root.

For example, this preset `foo-bar/jest-preset.js` will be configured as follows:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  preset: "foo-bar",
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  preset: "foo-bar",
};

export default config;
```

Presets may also be relative to filesystem paths:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  preset: "./node_modules/foo-bar/jest-preset.js",
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  preset: "./node_modules/foo-bar/jest-preset.js",
};

export default config;
```

:::info

If you also have specified [`rootDir`](#rootdir-string), the resolution of this file will be relative to that root directory.

:::

### `prettierPath` \[string]

Default: `'prettier'`

Sets the path to the [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) node module used to update inline snapshots.

### `projects` \[array&lt;string | ProjectConfig&gt;]

Default: `undefined`

When the `projects` configuration is provided with an array of paths or glob patterns, Jest will run tests in all of the specified projects at the same time. This is great for monorepos or when working on multiple projects at the same time.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  projects: ["<rootDir>", "<rootDir>/examples/*"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  projects: ["<rootDir>", "<rootDir>/examples/*"],
};

export default config;
```

This example configuration will run Jest in the root directory as well as in every folder in the examples directory. You can have an unlimited amount of projects running in the same Jest instance.

The projects feature can also be used to run multiple configurations or multiple [runners](#runner-string). For this purpose, you can pass an array of configuration objects. For example, to run both tests and ESLint (via [jest-runner-eslint](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-runner-eslint)) in the same invocation of Jest:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  projects: [
    {
      displayName: "test",
    },
    {
      displayName: "lint",
      runner: "jest-runner-eslint",
      testMatch: ["<rootDir>/**/*.js"],
    },
  ],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  projects: [
    {
      displayName: "test",
    },
    {
      displayName: "lint",
      runner: "jest-runner-eslint",
      testMatch: ["<rootDir>/**/*.js"],
    },
  ],
};

export default config;
```

:::tip

When using multi-project runner, it's recommended to add a `displayName` for each project. This will show the `displayName` of a project next to its tests.

:::

:::note

With the `projects` option enabled, Jest will copy the root-level configuration options to each individual child configuration during the test run, resolving its values in the child's context. This means that string tokens like `<rootDir>` will point to the _child's root directory_ even if they are defined in the root-level configuration.

:::

### `randomize` \[boolean]

Default: `false`

The equivalent of the [`--randomize`](CLI.md#--randomize) flag to randomize the order of the tests in a file.

### `reporters` \[array&lt;moduleName | \[moduleName, options]&gt;]

Default: `undefined`

Use this configuration option to add reporters to Jest. It must be a list of reporter names, additional options can be passed to a reporter using the tuple form:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  reporters: [
    "default",
    ["<rootDir>/custom-reporter.js", { banana: "yes", pineapple: "no" }],
  ],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  reporters: [
    "default",
    ["<rootDir>/custom-reporter.js", { banana: "yes", pineapple: "no" }],
  ],
};

export default config;
```

#### Default Reporter

If custom reporters are specified, the default Jest reporter will be overridden. If you wish to keep it, `'default'` must be passed as a reporters name:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  reporters: [
    "default",
    ["jest-junit", { outputDirectory: "reports", outputName: "report.xml" }],
  ],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  reporters: [
    "default",
    ["jest-junit", { outputDirectory: "reports", outputName: "report.xml" }],
  ],
};

export default config;
```

#### GitHub Actions Reporter

If included in the list, the built-in GitHub Actions Reporter will annotate changed files with test failure messages and (if used with `'silent: false'`) print logs with github group features for easy navigation. Note that `'default'` should not be used in this case as `'github-actions'` will handle that already, so remember to also include `'summary'`. If you wish to use it only for annotations simply leave only the reporter without options as the default value of `'silent'` is `'true'`:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  reporters: [["github-actions", { silent: false }], "summary"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  reporters: [["github-actions", { silent: false }], "summary"],
};

export default config;
```

#### Summary Reporter

Summary reporter prints out summary of all tests. It is a part of default reporter, hence it will be enabled if `'default'` is included in the list. For instance, you might want to use it as stand-alone reporter instead of the default one, or together with [Silent Reporter](https://github.com/rickhanlonii/jest-silent-reporter):

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  reporters: ["jest-silent-reporter", "summary"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  reporters: ["jest-silent-reporter", "summary"],
};

export default config;
```

The `summary` reporter accepts options. Since it is included in the `default` reporter you may also pass the options there.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  reporters: [["default", { summaryThreshold: 10 }]],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  reporters: [["default", { summaryThreshold: 10 }]],
};

export default config;
```

The `summaryThreshold` option behaves in the following way, if the total number of test suites surpasses this threshold, a detailed summary of all failed tests will be printed after executing all the tests. It defaults to `20`.

#### Custom Reporters

:::tip

Hungry for reporters? Take a look at long list of [awesome reporters](https://github.com/jest-community/awesome-jest/blob/main/README.md#reporters) from Awesome Jest.

:::

Custom reporter module must export a class that takes [`globalConfig`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/v29.2.1/packages/jest-types/src/Config.ts#L358-L422), `reporterOptions` and `reporterContext` as constructor arguments:

```js title="custom-reporter.js"
class CustomReporter {
  constructor(globalConfig, reporterOptions, reporterContext) {
    this._globalConfig = globalConfig;
    this._options = reporterOptions;
    this._context = reporterContext;
  }

  onRunComplete(testContexts, results) {
    console.log("Custom reporter output:");
    console.log("global config:", this._globalConfig);
    console.log("options for this reporter from Jest config:", this._options);
    console.log("reporter context passed from test scheduler:", this._context);
  }

  // Optionally, reporters can force Jest to exit with non zero code by returning
  // an `Error` from `getLastError()` method.
  getLastError() {
    if (this._shouldFail) {
      return new Error("Custom error reported!");
    }
  }
}

module.exports = CustomReporter;
```

:::note

For the full list of hooks and argument types see the `Reporter` interface in [packages/jest-reporters/src/types.ts](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/packages/jest-reporters/src/types.ts).

:::

### `resetMocks` \[boolean]

Default: `false`

Automatically reset mock state before every test. Equivalent to calling [`jest.resetAllMocks()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestresetallmocks) before each test. This will lead to any mocks having their fake implementations removed but does not restore their initial implementation.

### `resetModules` \[boolean]

Default: `false`

By default, each test file gets its own independent module registry. Enabling `resetModules` goes a step further and resets the module registry before running each individual test. This is useful to isolate modules for every test so that the local module state doesn't conflict between tests. This can be done programmatically using [`jest.resetModules()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestresetmodules).

### `resolver` \[string]

Default: `undefined`

This option allows the use of a custom resolver. This resolver must be a module that exports _either_:

1. a function expecting a string as the first argument for the path to resolve and an options object as the second argument. The function should either return a path to the module that should be resolved or throw an error if the module can't be found. _or_
2. an object containing `async` and/or `sync` properties. The `sync` property should be a function with the shape explained above, and the `async` property should also be a function that accepts the same arguments, but returns a promise which resolves with the path to the module or rejects with an error.

The options object provided to resolvers has the shape:

```ts
type ResolverOptions = {
  /** Directory to begin resolving from. */
  basedir: string;
  /** List of export conditions. */
  conditions?: Array<string>;
  /** Instance of default resolver. */
  defaultResolver: (path: string, options: ResolverOptions) => string;
  /** List of file extensions to search in order. */
  extensions?: Array<string>;
  /** List of directory names to be looked up for modules recursively. */
  moduleDirectory?: Array<string>;
  /** List of `require.paths` to use if nothing is found in `node_modules`. */
  paths?: Array<string>;
  /** Allows transforming parsed `package.json` contents. */
  packageFilter?: (pkg: PackageJSON, file: string, dir: string) => PackageJSON;
  /** Allows transforms a path within a package. */
  pathFilter?: (pkg: PackageJSON, path: string, relativePath: string) => string;
  /** Current root directory. */
  rootDir?: string;
};
```

:::tip

The `defaultResolver` passed as an option is the Jest default resolver which might be useful when you write your custom one. It takes the same arguments as your custom synchronous one, e.g. `(path, options)` and returns a string or throws.

:::

For example, if you want to respect Browserify's [`"browser"` field](https://github.com/browserify/browserify-handbook/blob/master/readme.markdown#browser-field), you can use the following resolver:

```js title="resolver.js"
const browserResolve = require("browser-resolve");

module.exports = browserResolve.sync;
```

And add it to Jest configuration:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  resolver: "<rootDir>/resolver.js",
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  resolver: "<rootDir>/resolver.js",
};

export default config;
```

By combining `defaultResolver` and `packageFilter` we can implement a `package.json` "pre-processor" that allows us to change how the default resolver will resolve modules. For example, imagine we want to use the field `"module"` if it is present, otherwise fallback to `"main"`:

```js
module.exports = (path, options) => {
  // Call the defaultResolver, so we leverage its cache, error handling, etc.
  return options.defaultResolver(path, {
    ...options,
    // Use packageFilter to process parsed `package.json` before the resolution (see https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve#resolveid-opts-cb)
    packageFilter: (pkg) => {
      return {
        ...pkg,
        // Alter the value of `main` before resolving the package
        main: pkg.module || pkg.main,
      };
    },
  });
};
```

### `restoreMocks` \[boolean]

Default: `false`

Automatically restore mock state and implementation before every test. Equivalent to calling [`jest.restoreAllMocks()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestrestoreallmocks) before each test. This will lead to any mocks having their fake implementations removed and restores their initial implementation.

### `rootDir` \[string]

Default: The root of the directory containing your Jest [config file](#) _or_ the `package.json` _or_ the [`pwd`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd) if no `package.json` is found

The root directory that Jest should scan for tests and modules within. If you put your Jest config inside your `package.json` and want the root directory to be the root of your repo, the value for this config param will default to the directory of the `package.json`.

Oftentimes, you'll want to set this to `'src'` or `'lib'`, corresponding to where in your repository the code is stored.

:::tip

Using `'<rootDir>'` as a string token in any other path-based configuration settings will refer back to this value. For example, if you want a [`setupFiles`](#setupfiles-array) entry to point at the `some-setup.js` file at the root of the project, set its value to: `'<rootDir>/some-setup.js'`.

:::

### `roots` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `["<rootDir>"]`

A list of paths to directories that Jest should use to search for files in.

There are times where you only want Jest to search in a single sub-directory (such as cases where you have a `src/` directory in your repo), but prevent it from accessing the rest of the repo.

:::info

While `rootDir` is mostly used as a token to be re-used in other configuration options, `roots` is used by the internals of Jest to locate **test files and source files**. This applies also when searching for manual mocks for modules from `node_modules` (`__mocks__` will need to live in one of the `roots`).

By default, `roots` has a single entry `<rootDir>` but there are cases where you may want to have multiple roots within one project, for example `roots: ["<rootDir>/src/", "<rootDir>/tests/"]`.

:::

### `runner` \[string]

Default: `"jest-runner"`

This option allows you to use a custom runner instead of Jest's default test runner. Examples of runners include:

- [`jest-runner-eslint`](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-runner-eslint)
- [`jest-runner-mocha`](https://github.com/rogeliog/jest-runner-mocha)
- [`jest-runner-tsc`](https://github.com/azz/jest-runner-tsc)
- [`jest-runner-prettier`](https://github.com/keplersj/jest-runner-prettier)

:::info

The `runner` property value can omit the `jest-runner-` prefix of the package name.

:::

To write a test-runner, export a class with which accepts [`globalConfig`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/v29.2.1/packages/jest-types/src/Config.ts#L358-L422) in the constructor, and has a `runTests` method with the signature:

```ts
async function runTests(
  tests: Array<Test>,
  watcher: TestWatcher,
  onStart: OnTestStart,
  onResult: OnTestSuccess,
  onFailure: OnTestFailure,
  options: TestRunnerOptions
): Promise<void>;
```

If you need to restrict your test-runner to only run in serial rather than being executed in parallel your class should have the property `isSerial` to be set as `true`.

### `sandboxInjectedGlobals` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

:::tip

Renamed from `extraGlobals` in Jest 28.

:::

Default: `undefined`

Test files run inside a [vm](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html), which slows calls to global context properties (e.g. `Math`). With this option you can specify extra properties to be defined inside the vm for faster lookups.

For example, if your tests call `Math` often, you can pass it by setting `sandboxInjectedGlobals`.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  sandboxInjectedGlobals: ["Math"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  sandboxInjectedGlobals: ["Math"],
};

export default config;
```

:::note

This option has no effect if you use [native ESM](ECMAScriptModules.md).

:::

### `setupFiles` \[array]

Default: `[]`

A list of paths to modules that run some code to configure or set up the testing environment. Each setupFile will be run once per test file. Since every test runs in its own environment, these scripts will be executed in the testing environment before executing [`setupFilesAfterEnv`](#setupfilesafterenv-array) and before the test code itself.

:::tip

If your setup script is a CJS module, it may export an async function. Jest will call the function and await its result. This might be useful to fetch some data asynchronously. If the file is an ESM module, simply use top-level await to achieve the same result.

:::

### `setupFilesAfterEnv` \[array]

Default: `[]`

A list of paths to modules that run some code to configure or set up the testing framework before each test file in the suite is executed. Since [`setupFiles`](#setupfiles-array) executes before the test framework is installed in the environment, this script file presents you the opportunity of running some code immediately after the test framework has been installed in the environment but before the test code itself.

In other words, `setupFilesAfterEnv` modules are meant for code which is repeating in each test file. Having the test framework installed makes Jest [globals](GlobalAPI.md), [`jest` object](JestObjectAPI.md) and [`expect`](ExpectAPI.md) accessible in the modules. For example, you can add extra matchers from [`jest-extended`](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended) library or call [setup and teardown](SetupAndTeardown.md) hooks:

```js title="setup-jest.js"
const matchers = require("jest-extended");
expect.extend(matchers);

afterEach(() => {
  jest.useRealTimers();
});
```

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["<rootDir>/setup-jest.js"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["<rootDir>/setup-jest.js"],
};

export default config;
```

:::tip

If your setup script is a CJS module, it may export an async function. Jest will call the function and await its result. This might be useful to fetch some data asynchronously. If the file is an ESM module, simply use top-level await to achieve the same result.

:::

### `showSeed` \[boolean]

Default: `false`

The equivalent of the [`--showSeed`](CLI.md#--showseed) flag to print the seed in the test report summary.

### `slowTestThreshold` \[number]

Default: `5`

The number of seconds after which a test is considered as slow and reported as such in the results.

### `snapshotFormat` \[object]

Default: `{escapeString: false, printBasicPrototype: false}`

Allows overriding specific snapshot formatting options documented in the [pretty-format readme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-format#usage-with-options), with the exceptions of `compareKeys` and `plugins`. For example, this config would have the snapshot formatter not print a prefix for "Object" and "Array":

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  snapshotFormat: {
    printBasicPrototype: false,
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  snapshotFormat: {
    printBasicPrototype: false,
  },
};

export default config;
```

```js title="some.test.js"
test("does not show prototypes for object and array inline", () => {
  const object = {
    array: [{ hello: "Danger" }],
  };
  expect(object).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    {
      "array": [
        {
          "hello": "Danger",
        },
      ],
    }
  `);
});
```

### `snapshotResolver` \[string]

Default: `undefined`

The path to a module that can resolve test\<->snapshot path. This config option lets you customize where Jest stores snapshot files on disk.

```js title="custom-resolver.js"
module.exports = {
  // resolves from test to snapshot path
  resolveSnapshotPath: (testPath, snapshotExtension) =>
    testPath.replace("__tests__", "__snapshots__") + snapshotExtension,

  // resolves from snapshot to test path
  resolveTestPath: (snapshotFilePath, snapshotExtension) =>
    snapshotFilePath
      .replace("__snapshots__", "__tests__")
      .slice(0, -snapshotExtension.length),

  // Example test path, used for preflight consistency check of the implementation above
  testPathForConsistencyCheck: "some/__tests__/example.test.js",
};
```

### `snapshotSerializers` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `[]`

A list of paths to snapshot serializer modules Jest should use for snapshot testing.

Jest has default serializers for built-in JavaScript types, HTML elements (Jest 20.0.0+), ImmutableJS (Jest 20.0.0+) and for React elements. See [snapshot test tutorial](TutorialReactNative.md#snapshot-test) for more information.

```js title="custom-serializer.js"
module.exports = {
  serialize(val, config, indentation, depth, refs, printer) {
    return `Pretty foo: ${printer(val.foo)}`;
  },

  test(val) {
    return val && Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(val, "foo");
  },
};
```

`printer` is a function that serializes a value using existing plugins.

Add `custom-serializer` to your Jest configuration:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  snapshotSerializers: ["path/to/custom-serializer.js"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  snapshotSerializers: ["path/to/custom-serializer.js"],
};

export default config;
```

Finally tests would look as follows:

```js
test(() => {
  const bar = {
    foo: {
      x: 1,
      y: 2,
    },
  };

  expect(bar).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

Rendered snapshot:

```json
Pretty foo: Object {
  "x": 1,
  "y": 2,
}
```

:::tip

To make a dependency explicit instead of implicit, you can call [`expect.addSnapshotSerializer`](ExpectAPI.md#expectaddsnapshotserializerserializer) to add a module for an individual test file instead of adding its path to `snapshotSerializers` in Jest configuration.

More about serializers API can be found [here](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/pretty-format/README.md#serialize).

:::

### `testEnvironment` \[string]

Default: `"node"`

The test environment that will be used for testing. The default environment in Jest is a Node.js environment. If you are building a web app, you can use a browser-like environment through [`jsdom`](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) instead.

By adding a `@jest-environment` docblock at the top of the file, you can specify another environment to be used for all tests in that file:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

test("use jsdom in this test file", () => {
  const element = document.createElement("div");
  expect(element).not.toBeNull();
});
```

You can create your own module that will be used for setting up the test environment. The module must export a class with `setup`, `teardown` and `getVmContext` methods. You can also pass variables from this module to your test suites by assigning them to `this.global` object &ndash; this will make them available in your test suites as global variables. The constructor is passed [`globalConfig`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/v29.2.1/packages/jest-types/src/Config.ts#L358-L422) and [`projectConfig`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/v29.2.1/packages/jest-types/src/Config.ts#L424-L481) as its first argument, and [`testEnvironmentContext`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/491e7cb0f2daa8263caccc72d48bdce7ba759b11/packages/jest-environment/src/index.ts#L13) as its second.

The class may optionally expose an asynchronous `handleTestEvent` method to bind to events fired by [`jest-circus`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/jest-circus). Normally, `jest-circus` test runner would pause until a promise returned from `handleTestEvent` gets fulfilled, **except for the next events**: `start_describe_definition`, `finish_describe_definition`, `add_hook`, `add_test` or `error` (for the up-to-date list you can look at [SyncEvent type in the types definitions](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/jest-types/src/Circus.ts)). That is caused by backward compatibility reasons and `process.on('unhandledRejection', callback)` signature, but that usually should not be a problem for most of the use cases.

Any docblock pragmas in test files will be passed to the environment constructor and can be used for per-test configuration. If the pragma does not have a value, it will be present in the object with its value set to an empty string. If the pragma is not present, it will not be present in the object.

To use this class as your custom environment, refer to it by its full path within the project. For example, if your class is stored in `my-custom-environment.js` in some subfolder of your project, then the annotation might look like this:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment ./src/test/my-custom-environment
 */
```

:::info

TestEnvironment is sandboxed. Each test suite will trigger setup/teardown in their own TestEnvironment.

:::

Example:

```js
// my-custom-environment
const NodeEnvironment = require("jest-environment-node").TestEnvironment;

class CustomEnvironment extends NodeEnvironment {
  constructor(config, context) {
    super(config, context);
    console.log(config.globalConfig);
    console.log(config.projectConfig);
    this.testPath = context.testPath;
    this.docblockPragmas = context.docblockPragmas;
  }

  async setup() {
    await super.setup();
    await someSetupTasks(this.testPath);
    this.global.someGlobalObject = createGlobalObject();

    // Will trigger if docblock contains @my-custom-pragma my-pragma-value
    if (this.docblockPragmas["my-custom-pragma"] === "my-pragma-value") {
      // ...
    }
  }

  async teardown() {
    this.global.someGlobalObject = destroyGlobalObject();
    await someTeardownTasks();
    await super.teardown();
  }

  getVmContext() {
    return super.getVmContext();
  }

  async handleTestEvent(event, state) {
    if (event.name === "test_start") {
      // ...
    }
  }
}

module.exports = CustomEnvironment;
```

```js
// my-test-suite
/**
 * @jest-environment ./my-custom-environment
 */
let someGlobalObject;

beforeAll(() => {
  someGlobalObject = globalThis.someGlobalObject;
});
```

### `testEnvironmentOptions` \[Object]

Default: `{}`

Test environment options that will be passed to the `testEnvironment`. The relevant options depend on the environment.

For example, you can override options passed to [`jsdom`](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom):

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  testEnvironment: "jsdom",
  testEnvironmentOptions: {
    html: '<html lang="zh-cmn-Hant"></html>',
    url: "https://jestjs.io/",
    userAgent: "Agent/007",
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  testEnvironment: "jsdom",
  testEnvironmentOptions: {
    html: '<html lang="zh-cmn-Hant"></html>',
    url: "https://jestjs.io/",
    userAgent: "Agent/007",
  },
};

export default config;
```

Both `jest-environment-jsdom` and `jest-environment-node` allow specifying `customExportConditions`, which allow you to control which versions of a library are loaded from `exports` in `package.json`. `jest-environment-jsdom` defaults to `['browser']`. `jest-environment-node` defaults to `['node', 'node-addons']`.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  testEnvironment: "jsdom",
  testEnvironmentOptions: {
    customExportConditions: ["react-native"],
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  testEnvironment: "jsdom",
  testEnvironmentOptions: {
    customExportConditions: ["react-native"],
  },
};

export default config;
```

These options can also be passed in a docblock, similar to `testEnvironment`. The string with options must be parseable by `JSON.parse`:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 * @jest-environment-options {"url": "https://jestjs.io/"}
 */

test("use jsdom and set the URL in this test file", () => {
  expect(window.location.href).toBe("https://jestjs.io/");
});
```

### `testFailureExitCode` \[number]

Default: `1`

The exit code Jest returns on test failure.

:::info

This does not change the exit code in the case of Jest errors (e.g. invalid configuration).

:::

### `testMatch` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

(default: `[ "**/__tests__/**/*.?([mc])[jt]s?(x)", "**/?(*.)+(spec|test).?([mc])[jt]s?(x)" ]`)

The glob patterns Jest uses to detect test files. By default it looks for `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts` and `.tsx` files inside of `__tests__` folders, as well as any files with a suffix of `.test` or `.spec` (e.g. `Component.test.js` or `Component.spec.js`). It will also find files called `test.js` or `spec.js`.

See the [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) package for details of the patterns you can specify.

See also [`testRegex` [string | array&lt;string&gt;]](#testregex-string--arraystring), but note that you cannot specify both options.

:::tip

Each glob pattern is applied in the order they are specified in the config. For example `["!**/__fixtures__/**", "**/__tests__/**/*.js"]` will not exclude `__fixtures__` because the negation is overwritten with the second pattern. In order to make the negated glob work in this example it has to come after `**/__tests__/**/*.js`.

:::

### `testPathIgnorePatterns` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `["/node_modules/"]`

An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all test paths before executing the test. If the test path matches any of the patterns, it will be skipped.

These pattern strings match against the full path. Use the `<rootDir>` string token to include the path to your project's root directory to prevent it from accidentally ignoring all of your files in different environments that may have different root directories. Example: `["<rootDir>/build/", "<rootDir>/node_modules/"]`.

### `testRegex` \[string | array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `(/__tests__/.*|(\\.|/)(test|spec))\\.[mc]?[jt]sx?$`

The pattern or patterns Jest uses to detect test files. By default it looks for `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts` and `.tsx` files inside of `__tests__` folders, as well as any files with a suffix of `.test` or `.spec` (e.g. `Component.test.js` or `Component.spec.js`). It will also find files called `test.js` or `spec.js`. See also [`testMatch` [array&lt;string&gt;]](#testmatch-arraystring), but note that you cannot specify both options.

The following is a visualization of the default regex:

```bash
├── __tests__
│   └── component.spec.js # test
│   └── anything # test
├── package.json # not test
├── foo.test.js # test
├── bar.spec.jsx # test
└── component.js # not test
```

:::info

`testRegex` will try to detect test files using the **absolute file path**, therefore, having a folder with a name that matches it will run all the files as tests.

:::

### `testResultsProcessor` \[string]

Default: `undefined`

This option allows the use of a custom results processor. This processor must be a node module that exports a function expecting an object with the following structure as the first argument and return it:

```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "startTime": epoch,
  "numTotalTestSuites": number,
  "numPassedTestSuites": number,
  "numFailedTestSuites": number,
  "numRuntimeErrorTestSuites": number,
  "numTotalTests": number,
  "numPassedTests": number,
  "numFailedTests": number,
  "numPendingTests": number,
  "numTodoTests": number,
  "openHandles": Array<Error>,
  "testResults": [{
    "numFailingTests": number,
    "numPassingTests": number,
    "numPendingTests": number,
    "testResults": [{
      "title": string (message in it block),
      "status": "failed" | "pending" | "passed",
      "ancestorTitles": [string (message in describe blocks)],
      "failureMessages": [string],
      "numPassingAsserts": number,
      "location": {
        "column": number,
        "line": number
      },
      "duration": number | null,
      "startAt": epoch | null
    },
    ...
    ],
    "perfStats": {
      "end": epoch,
      "loadTestEnvironmentEnd": epoch,
      "loadTestEnvironmentStart": epoch,
      "runtime": number,
      "setupAfterEnvEnd": epoch,
      "setupAfterEnvStart": epoch,
      "setupFilesEnd": epoch,
      "setupFilesStart": epoch,
      "slow": boolean,
      "start": epoch
    },
    "testFilePath": absolute path to test file,
    "coverage": {}
  },
  "testExecError:" (exists if there was a top-level failure) {
    "message": string
    "stack": string
  }
  ...
  ]
}
```

`testResultsProcessor` and `reporters` are very similar to each other. One difference is that a test result processor only gets called after all tests finished. Whereas a reporter has the ability to receive test results after individual tests and/or test suites are finished.

### `testRunner` \[string]

Default: `jest-circus/runner`

This option allows the use of a custom test runner. The default is `jest-circus`. A custom test runner can be provided by specifying a path to a test runner implementation.

The test runner module must export a function with the following signature:

```ts
function testRunner(
  globalConfig: GlobalConfig,
  config: ProjectConfig,
  environment: Environment,
  runtime: Runtime,
  testPath: string
): Promise<TestResult>;
```

An example of such function can be found in our default [jasmine2 test runner package](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/packages/jest-jasmine2/src/index.ts).

### `testSequencer` \[string]

Default: `@jest/test-sequencer`

This option allows you to use a custom sequencer instead of Jest's default.

:::tip

Both `sort` and `shard` may optionally return a `Promise`.

:::

For example, you may sort test paths alphabetically:

```js title="custom-sequencer.js"
const Sequencer = require("@jest/test-sequencer").default;

class CustomSequencer extends Sequencer {
  /**
   * Select tests for shard requested via --shard=shardIndex/shardCount
   * Sharding is applied before sorting
   */
  shard(tests, { shardIndex, shardCount }) {
    const shardSize = Math.ceil(tests.length / shardCount);
    const shardStart = shardSize * (shardIndex - 1);
    const shardEnd = shardSize * shardIndex;

    return [...tests]
      .sort((a, b) => (a.path > b.path ? 1 : -1))
      .slice(shardStart, shardEnd);
  }

  /**
   * Sort test to determine order of execution
   * Sorting is applied after sharding
   */
  sort(tests) {
    // Test structure information
    // https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/6b8b1404a1d9254e7d5d90a8934087a9c9899dab/packages/jest-runner/src/types.ts#L17-L21
    const copyTests = [...tests];
    return copyTests.sort((testA, testB) => (testA.path > testB.path ? 1 : -1));
  }
}

module.exports = CustomSequencer;
```

Add `custom-sequencer` to your Jest configuration:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  testSequencer: "path/to/custom-sequencer.js",
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  testSequencer: "path/to/custom-sequencer.js",
};

export default config;
```

### `testTimeout` \[number]

Default: `5000`

Default timeout of a test in milliseconds.

### `transform` \[object&lt;string, pathToTransformer | \[pathToTransformer, object]&gt;]

Default: `{"\\.[jt]sx?$": "babel-jest"}`

A map from regular expressions to paths to transformers. Optionally, a tuple with configuration options can be passed as second argument: `{filePattern: ['path-to-transformer', {options}]}`. For example, here is how you can configure `babel-jest` for non-default behavior: `{'\\.js$': ['babel-jest', {rootMode: 'upward'}]}`.

Jest runs the code of your project as JavaScript, hence a transformer is needed if you use some syntax not supported by Node out of the box (such as JSX, TypeScript, Vue templates). By default, Jest will use [`babel-jest`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/babel-jest#setup) transformer, which will load your project's Babel configuration and transform any file matching the `/\.[jt]sx?$/` RegExp (in other words, any `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts` or `.tsx` file). In addition, `babel-jest` will inject the Babel plugin necessary for mock hoisting talked about in [ES Module mocking](ManualMocks.md#using-with-es-module-imports).

See the [Code Transformation](CodeTransformation.md) section for more details and instructions on building your own transformer.

:::tip

Keep in mind that a transformer only runs once per file unless the file has changed.

Remember to include the default `babel-jest` transformer explicitly, if you wish to use it alongside with additional code preprocessors:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  transform: {
    "\\.[jt]sx?$": "babel-jest",
    "\\.css$": "some-css-transformer",
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  transform: {
    "\\.[jt]sx?$": "babel-jest",
    "\\.css$": "some-css-transformer",
  },
};

export default config;
```

:::

### `transformIgnorePatterns` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `["/node_modules/", "\\.pnp\\.[^\\\/]+$"]`

An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all source file paths before transformation. If the file path matches **any** of the patterns, it will not be transformed.

Providing regexp patterns that overlap with each other may result in files not being transformed that you expected to be transformed. For example:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  transformIgnorePatterns: ["/node_modules/(?!(foo|bar)/)", "/bar/"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  transformIgnorePatterns: ["/node_modules/(?!(foo|bar)/)", "/bar/"],
};

export default config;
```

The first pattern will match (and therefore not transform) files inside `/node_modules` except for those in `/node_modules/foo/` and `/node_modules/bar/`. The second pattern will match (and therefore not transform) files inside any path with `/bar/` in it. With the two together, files in `/node_modules/bar/` will not be transformed because it does match the second pattern, even though it was excluded by the first.

Sometimes it happens (especially in React Native or TypeScript projects) that 3rd party modules are published as untranspiled code. Since all files inside `node_modules` are not transformed by default, Jest will not understand the code in these modules, resulting in syntax errors. To overcome this, you may use `transformIgnorePatterns` to allow transpiling such modules. You'll find a good example of this use case in [React Native Guide](/docs/tutorial-react-native#transformignorepatterns-customization).

These pattern strings match against the full path. Use the `<rootDir>` string token to include the path to your project's root directory to prevent it from accidentally ignoring all of your files in different environments that may have different root directories.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    "<rootDir>/bower_components/",
    "<rootDir>/node_modules/",
  ],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    "<rootDir>/bower_components/",
    "<rootDir>/node_modules/",
  ],
};

export default config;
```

:::tip

If you use `pnpm` and need to convert some packages under `node_modules`, you need to note that the packages in this folder (e.g. `node_modules/package-a/`) have been symlinked to the path under `.pnpm` (e.g. `node_modules/.pnpm/package-a@x.x.x/node_modules/package-a/`), so using `<rootDir>/node_modules/(?!(package-a|@scope/pkg-b)/)` directly will not be recognized, while is to use:

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    "<rootDir>/node_modules/.pnpm/(?!(package-a|@scope\\+pkg-b)@)",
    /* if config file is under '~/packages/lib-a/' */
    `${path.join(
      __dirname,
      "../.."
    )}/node_modules/.pnpm/(?!(package-a|@scope\\+pkg-b)@)`,
    /* or using relative pattern to match the second 'node_modules/' in 'node_modules/.pnpm/@scope+pkg-b@x.x.x/node_modules/@scope/pkg-b/' */
    "node_modules/(?!.pnpm|package-a|@scope/pkg-b)",
  ],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    "<rootDir>/node_modules/.pnpm/(?!(package-a|@scope\\+pkg-b)@)",
    /* if config file is under '~/packages/lib-a/' */
    `${path.join(
      __dirname,
      "../.."
    )}/node_modules/.pnpm/(?!(package-a|@scope\\+pkg-b)@)`,
    /* or using relative path to match the second 'node_modules/' in 'node_modules/.pnpm/@scope+pkg-b@x.x.x/node_modules/@scope/pkg-b/' */
    "node_modules/(?!.pnpm|package-a|@scope/pkg-b)",
  ],
};

export default config;
```

It should be noted that the folder name of pnpm under `.pnpm` is the package name plus `@` and version number, so writing `/` will not be recognized, but using `@` can.

:::

### `unmockedModulePathPatterns` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `[]`

An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all modules before the module loader will automatically return a mock for them. If a module's path matches any of the patterns in this list, it will not be automatically mocked by the module loader.

This is useful for some commonly used 'utility' modules that are almost always used as implementation details almost all the time (like `underscore`, `lodash`, etc). It's generally a best practice to keep this list as small as possible and always use explicit `jest.mock()`/`jest.unmock()` calls in individual tests. Explicit per-test setup is far easier for other readers of the test to reason about the environment the test will run in.

It is possible to override this setting in individual tests by explicitly calling `jest.mock()` at the top of the test file.

### `verbose` \[boolean]

Default: `false` or `true` if there is only one test file to run

Indicates whether each individual test should be reported during the run. All errors will also still be shown on the bottom after execution.

### `waitNextEventLoopTurnForUnhandledRejectionEvents` \[boolean]

Gives one event loop turn to handle `rejectionHandled`, `uncaughtException` or `unhandledRejection`.

Without this flag Jest may report false-positive errors (e.g. actually handled rejection reported) or not report actually unhandled rejection (or report it for different test case).

This option may add a noticeable overhead for fast test suites.

### `watchPathIgnorePatterns` \[array&lt;string&gt;]

Default: `[]`

An array of RegExp patterns that are matched against all source file paths before re-running tests in watch mode. If the file path matches any of the patterns, when it is updated, it will not trigger a re-run of tests.

These patterns match against the full path. Use the `<rootDir>` string token to include the path to your project's root directory to prevent it from accidentally ignoring all of your files in different environments that may have different root directories. Example: `["<rootDir>/node_modules/"]`.

Even if nothing is specified here, the watcher will ignore changes to the version control folders (.git, .hg, .sl). Other hidden files and directories, i.e. those that begin with a dot (`.`), are watched by default. Remember to escape the dot when you add them to `watchPathIgnorePatterns` as it is a special RegExp character.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  watchPathIgnorePatterns: ["<rootDir>/\\.tmp/", "<rootDir>/bar/"],
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  watchPathIgnorePatterns: ["<rootDir>/\\.tmp/", "<rootDir>/bar/"],
};

export default config;
```

### `watchPlugins` \[array&lt;string | \[string, Object]&gt;]

Default: `[]`

This option allows you to use custom watch plugins. Read more about watch plugins [here](watch-plugins).

Examples of watch plugins include:

- [`jest-watch-master`](https://github.com/rickhanlonii/jest-watch-master)
- [`jest-watch-select-projects`](https://github.com/rogeliog/jest-watch-select-projects)
- [`jest-watch-suspend`](https://github.com/unional/jest-watch-suspend)
- [`jest-watch-typeahead`](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-watch-typeahead)
- [`jest-watch-yarn-workspaces`](https://github.com/cameronhunter/jest-watch-directories/tree/master/packages/jest-watch-yarn-workspaces)

:::info

The values in the `watchPlugins` property value can omit the `jest-watch-` prefix of the package name.

:::

### `watchman` \[boolean]

Default: `true`

Whether to use [`watchman`](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) for file crawling.

### `workerIdleMemoryLimit` \[number|string]

Default: `undefined`

Specifies the memory limit for workers before they are recycled and is primarily a work-around for [this issue](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/issues/11956);

After the worker has executed a test the memory usage of it is checked. If it exceeds the value specified the worker is killed and restarted. The limit can be specified in a number of different ways and whatever the result is `Math.floor` is used to turn it into an integer value:

- `<= 1` - The value is assumed to be a percentage of system memory. So 0.5 sets the memory limit of the worker to half of the total system memory
- `\> 1` - Assumed to be a fixed byte value. Because of the previous rule if you wanted a value of 1 byte (I don't know why) you could use `1.1`.
- With units
  - `50%` - As above, a percentage of total system memory
  - `100KB`, `65MB`, etc - With units to denote a fixed memory limit.
    - `K` / `KB` - Kilobytes (x1000)
    - `KiB` - Kibibytes (x1024)
    - `M` / `MB` - Megabytes
    - `MiB` - Mebibytes
    - `G` / `GB` - Gigabytes
    - `GiB` - Gibibytes

:::caution

Percentage based memory limit [does not work on Linux CircleCI workers](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/issues/11956#issuecomment-1212925677) due to incorrect system memory being reported.

:::

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  workerIdleMemoryLimit: 0.2,
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  workerIdleMemoryLimit: 0.2,
};

export default config;
```

### `//` \[string]

This option allows comments in `package.json`. Include the comment text as the value of this key:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "jest": {
    "//": "Comment goes here",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

### `workerThreads`

Default: `false`

Whether to use [worker threads](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/worker_threads.html) for parallelization. [Child processes](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/child_process.html) are used by default.

Using worker threads may help to improve [performance](https://github.com/nodejs/node/discussions/44264).

:::caution

This is **experimental feature**. Keep in mind that the worker threads use structured clone instead of `JSON.stringify()` to serialize messages. This means that built-in JavaScript objects as `BigInt`, `Map` or `Set` will get serialized properly. However extra properties set on `Error`, `Map` or `Set` will not be passed on through the serialization step. For more details see the article on [structured clone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm).

## File: docs/DynamoDB.md

````markdown
---
id: dynamodb
title: Using with DynamoDB
---

With the [Global Setup/Teardown](Configuration.md#globalsetup-string) and [Async Test Environment](Configuration.md#testenvironment-string) APIs, Jest can work smoothly with [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

## Use jest-dynamodb Preset

[Jest DynamoDB](https://github.com/shelfio/jest-dynamodb) provides all required configuration to run your tests using DynamoDB.

1.  First, install `@shelf/jest-dynamodb`

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @shelf/jest-dynamodb
```

2.  Specify preset in your Jest configuration:

```json
{
  "preset": "@shelf/jest-dynamodb"
}
```

3.  Create `jest-dynamodb-config.js` and define DynamoDB tables

See [Create Table API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/DynamoDB.html#createTable-property)

```js
module.exports = {
  tables: [
    {
      TableName: `files`,
      KeySchema: [{ AttributeName: "id", KeyType: "HASH" }],
      AttributeDefinitions: [{ AttributeName: "id", AttributeType: "S" }],
      ProvisionedThroughput: { ReadCapacityUnits: 1, WriteCapacityUnits: 1 },
    },
    // etc
  ],
};
```

4.  Configure DynamoDB client

```js
const { DocumentClient } = require("aws-sdk/clients/dynamodb");

const isTest = process.env.JEST_WORKER_ID;
const config = {
  convertEmptyValues: true,
  ...(isTest && {
    endpoint: "localhost:8000",
    sslEnabled: false,
    region: "local-env",
  }),
};

const ddb = new DocumentClient(config);
```

5.  Write tests

```js
it("should insert item into table", async () => {
  await ddb
    .put({ TableName: "files", Item: { id: "1", hello: "world" } })
    .promise();

  const { Item } = await ddb
    .get({ TableName: "files", Key: { id: "1" } })
    .promise();

  expect(Item).toEqual({
    id: "1",
    hello: "world",
  });
});
```

There's no need to load any dependencies.

See [documentation](https://github.com/shelfio/jest-dynamodb) for details.

## File: docs/ECMAScriptModules.md

````markdown
---
id: ecmascript-modules
title: ECMAScript Modules
---

:::caution

Jest ships with **experimental** support for ECMAScript Modules (ESM).

The implementation may have bugs and lack features. For the latest status check out the [issue](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/issues/9430) and the [label](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/labels/ES%20Modules) on the issue tracker.

Also note that the APIs Jest uses to implement ESM support are still [considered experimental by Node](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html#vm_class_vm_module) (as of version `18.8.0`).

:::

With the warnings out of the way, this is how you activate ESM support in your tests.

1. Ensure you either disable [code transforms](Configuration.md#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object) by passing `transform: {}` or otherwise configure your transformer to emit ESM rather than the default CommonJS (CJS).
1. Execute `node` with `--experimental-vm-modules`, e.g. `node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js` or `NODE_OPTIONS="$NODE_OPTIONS --experimental-vm-modules" npx jest` etc.

   On Windows, you can use [`cross-env`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env) to be able to set environment variables.

   If you use Yarn, you can use `yarn node --experimental-vm-modules $(yarn bin jest)`. This command will also work if you use [Yarn Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp).

   If your codebase includes ESM imports from `*.wasm` files, you do _not_ need to pass `--experimental-wasm-modules` to `node`. Current implementation of WebAssembly imports in Jest relies on experimental VM modules, however, this may change in the future.

1. Beyond that, we attempt to follow `node`'s logic for activating "ESM mode" (such as looking at `type` in `package.json` or `.mjs` files), see [their docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_enabling) for details.
1. If you want to treat other file extensions (such as `.jsx` or `.ts`) as ESM, please use the [`extensionsToTreatAsEsm` option](Configuration.md#extensionstotreatasesm-arraystring).

## Differences between ESM and CommonJS

Most of the differences are explained in [Node's documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_differences_between_es_modules_and_commonjs), but in addition to the things mentioned there, Jest injects a special variable into all executed files - the [`jest` object](JestObjectAPI.md). To access this object in ESM, you need to import it from the `@jest/globals` module or use `import.meta`.

```js
import { jest } from "@jest/globals";

jest.useFakeTimers();

// etc.

// alternatively
import.meta.jest.useFakeTimers();

// jest === import.meta.jest => true
```

## Module mocking in ESM

Since ESM evaluates static `import` statements before looking at the code, the hoisting of `jest.mock` calls that happens in CJS won't work for ESM. To mock modules in ESM, you need to use `require` or dynamic `import()` after `jest.mock` calls to load the mocked modules - the same applies to modules which load the mocked modules.

ESM mocking is supported through `jest.unstable_mockModule`. As the name suggests, this API is still work in progress, please follow [this issue](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/issues/10025) for updates.

The usage of `jest.unstable_mockModule` is essentially the same as `jest.mock` with two differences: the factory function is required and it can be sync or async:

```js
import { jest } from "@jest/globals";

jest.unstable_mockModule("node:child_process", () => ({
  execSync: jest.fn(),
  // etc.
}));

const { execSync } = await import("node:child_process");

// etc.
```

## Module unmocking in ESM

```js title="esm-module.mjs"
export default () => {
  return "default";
};

export const namedFn = () => {
  return "namedFn";
};
```

```js title="esm-module.test.mjs"
import { jest, test } from "@jest/globals";

test("test esm-module", async () => {
  jest.unstable_mockModule("./esm-module.js", () => ({
    default: () => "default implementation",
    namedFn: () => "namedFn implementation",
  }));

  const mockModule = await import("./esm-module.js");

  console.log(mockModule.default()); // 'default implementation'
  console.log(mockModule.namedFn()); // 'namedFn implementation'

  jest.unstable_unmockModule("./esm-module.js");

  const originalModule = await import("./esm-module.js");

  console.log(originalModule.default()); // 'default'
  console.log(originalModule.namedFn()); // 'namedFn'

  /* !!! WARNING !!! Don`t override */
  jest.unstable_mockModule("./esm-module.js", () => ({
    default: () => "default override implementation",
    namedFn: () => "namedFn override implementation",
  }));

  const mockModuleOverride = await import("./esm-module.js");

  console.log(mockModuleOverride.default()); // 'default implementation'
  console.log(mockModuleOverride.namedFn()); // 'namedFn implementation'
});
```

## Mocking CJS modules

For mocking CJS modules, you should continue to use `jest.mock`. See the example below:

```js title="main.cjs"
const { BrowserWindow, app } = require("electron");

// etc.

module.exports = { example };
```

```js title="main.test.cjs"
import { createRequire } from "node:module";
import { jest } from "@jest/globals";

const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

jest.mock("electron", () => ({
  app: {
    on: jest.fn(),
    whenReady: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
  },
  BrowserWindow: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
    // partial mocks.
  })),
}));

const { BrowserWindow } = require("electron");
const exported = require("./main.cjs");

// alternatively
const { BrowserWindow } = (await import("electron")).default;
const exported = await import("./main.cjs");

// etc.
```
````

## File: docs/EnvironmentVariables.md

```markdown
---
id: environment-variables
title: Environment Variables
---

Jest sets the following environment variables:

### `NODE_ENV`

Set to `'test'` if it's not already set to something else.

### `JEST_WORKER_ID`

Each worker process is assigned a unique id (index-based that starts with `1`). This is set to `1` for all tests when [`runInBand`](CLI.md#--runinband) is set to true.
```

## File: docs/Es6ClassMocks.md

````markdown
---
id: es6-class-mocks
title: ES6 Class Mocks
---

Jest can be used to mock ES6 classes that are imported into files you want to test.

ES6 classes are constructor functions with some syntactic sugar. Therefore, any mock for an ES6 class must be a function or an actual ES6 class (which is, again, another function). So you can mock them using [mock functions](MockFunctions.md).

## An ES6 Class Example

We'll use a contrived example of a class that plays sound files, `SoundPlayer`, and a consumer class which uses that class, `SoundPlayerConsumer`. We'll mock `SoundPlayer` in our tests for `SoundPlayerConsumer`.

```javascript title="sound-player.js"
export default class SoundPlayer {
  constructor() {
    this.foo = "bar";
  }

  playSoundFile(fileName) {
    console.log("Playing sound file " + fileName);
  }
}
```

```javascript title="sound-player-consumer.js"
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";

export default class SoundPlayerConsumer {
  constructor() {
    this.soundPlayer = new SoundPlayer();
  }

  playSomethingCool() {
    const coolSoundFileName = "song.mp3";
    this.soundPlayer.playSoundFile(coolSoundFileName);
  }
}
```

## The 4 ways to create an ES6 class mock

### Automatic mock

Calling `jest.mock('./sound-player')` returns a useful "automatic mock" you can use to spy on calls to the class constructor and all of its methods. It replaces the ES6 class with a mock constructor, and replaces all of its methods with [mock functions](MockFunctions.md) that always return `undefined`. Method calls are saved in `theAutomaticMock.mock.instances[index].methodName.mock.calls`.

:::note

If you use arrow functions in your classes, they will _not_ be part of the mock. The reason for that is that arrow functions are not present on the object's prototype, they are merely properties holding a reference to a function.

:::

If you don't need to replace the implementation of the class, this is the easiest option to set up. For example:

```javascript
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";
import SoundPlayerConsumer from "./sound-player-consumer";
jest.mock("./sound-player"); // SoundPlayer is now a mock constructor

beforeEach(() => {
  // Clear all instances and calls to constructor and all methods:
  SoundPlayer.mockClear();
});

it("We can check if the consumer called the class constructor", () => {
  const soundPlayerConsumer = new SoundPlayerConsumer();
  expect(SoundPlayer).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});

it("We can check if the consumer called a method on the class instance", () => {
  // Show that mockClear() is working:
  expect(SoundPlayer).not.toHaveBeenCalled();

  const soundPlayerConsumer = new SoundPlayerConsumer();
  // Constructor should have been called again:
  expect(SoundPlayer).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

  const coolSoundFileName = "song.mp3";
  soundPlayerConsumer.playSomethingCool();

  // mock.instances is available with automatic mocks:
  const mockSoundPlayerInstance = SoundPlayer.mock.instances[0];
  const mockPlaySoundFile = mockSoundPlayerInstance.playSoundFile;
  expect(mockPlaySoundFile.mock.calls[0][0]).toBe(coolSoundFileName);
  // Equivalent to above check:
  expect(mockPlaySoundFile).toHaveBeenCalledWith(coolSoundFileName);
  expect(mockPlaySoundFile).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

### Manual mock

Create a [manual mock](ManualMocks.md) by saving a mock implementation in the `__mocks__` folder. This allows you to specify the implementation, and it can be used across test files.

```javascript title="__mocks__/sound-player.js"
// Import this named export into your test file:
export const mockPlaySoundFile = jest.fn();
const mock = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
  return { playSoundFile: mockPlaySoundFile };
});

export default mock;
```

Import the mock and the mock method shared by all instances:

```javascript title="sound-player-consumer.test.js"
import SoundPlayer, { mockPlaySoundFile } from "./sound-player";
import SoundPlayerConsumer from "./sound-player-consumer";
jest.mock("./sound-player"); // SoundPlayer is now a mock constructor

beforeEach(() => {
  // Clear all instances and calls to constructor and all methods:
  SoundPlayer.mockClear();
  mockPlaySoundFile.mockClear();
});

it("We can check if the consumer called the class constructor", () => {
  const soundPlayerConsumer = new SoundPlayerConsumer();
  expect(SoundPlayer).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});

it("We can check if the consumer called a method on the class instance", () => {
  const soundPlayerConsumer = new SoundPlayerConsumer();
  const coolSoundFileName = "song.mp3";
  soundPlayerConsumer.playSomethingCool();
  expect(mockPlaySoundFile).toHaveBeenCalledWith(coolSoundFileName);
});
```

### Calling [`jest.mock()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestmockmodulename-factory-options) with the module factory parameter

`jest.mock(path, moduleFactory)` takes a **module factory** argument. A module factory is a function that returns the mock.

In order to mock a constructor function, the module factory must return a constructor function. In other words, the module factory must be a function that returns a function - a higher-order function (HOF).

```javascript
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";
const mockPlaySoundFile = jest.fn();
jest.mock("./sound-player", () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return { playSoundFile: mockPlaySoundFile };
  });
});
```

:::caution

Since calls to `jest.mock()` are hoisted to the top of the file, Jest prevents access to out-of-scope variables. By default, you cannot first define a variable and then use it in the factory. Jest will disable this check for variables that start with the word `mock`. However, it is still up to you to guarantee that they will be initialized on time. Be aware of [Temporal Dead Zone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_tdz).

:::

For example, the following will throw an out-of-scope error due to the use of `fake` instead of `mock` in the variable declaration.

```javascript
// Note: this will fail
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";
const fakePlaySoundFile = jest.fn();
jest.mock("./sound-player", () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return { playSoundFile: fakePlaySoundFile };
  });
});
```

The following will throw a `ReferenceError` despite using `mock` in the variable declaration, as the `mockSoundPlayer` is not wrapped in an arrow function and thus accessed before initialization after hoisting.

```javascript
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";
const mockSoundPlayer = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
  return { playSoundFile: mockPlaySoundFile };
});
// results in a ReferenceError
jest.mock("./sound-player", () => {
  return mockSoundPlayer;
});
```

### Replacing the mock using [`mockImplementation()`](MockFunctionAPI.md#mockfnmockimplementationfn) or [`mockImplementationOnce()`](MockFunctionAPI.md#mockfnmockimplementationoncefn)

You can replace all of the above mocks in order to change the implementation, for a single test or all tests, by calling `mockImplementation()` on the existing mock.

Calls to jest.mock are hoisted to the top of the code. You can specify a mock later, e.g. in `beforeAll()`, by calling `mockImplementation()` (or `mockImplementationOnce()`) on the existing mock instead of using the factory parameter. This also allows you to change the mock between tests, if needed:

```javascript
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";
import SoundPlayerConsumer from "./sound-player-consumer";

jest.mock("./sound-player");

describe("When SoundPlayer throws an error", () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
    SoundPlayer.mockImplementation(() => {
      return {
        playSoundFile: () => {
          throw new Error("Test error");
        },
      };
    });
  });

  it("Should throw an error when calling playSomethingCool", () => {
    const soundPlayerConsumer = new SoundPlayerConsumer();
    expect(() => soundPlayerConsumer.playSomethingCool()).toThrow();
  });
});
```

## In depth: Understanding mock constructor functions

Building your constructor function mock using `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` makes mocks appear more complicated than they really are. This section shows how you can create your own mocks to illustrate how mocking works.

### Manual mock that is another ES6 class

If you define an ES6 class using the same filename as the mocked class in the `__mocks__` folder, it will serve as the mock. This class will be used in place of the real class. This allows you to inject a test implementation for the class, but does not provide a way to spy on calls.

For the contrived example, the mock might look like this:

```javascript title="__mocks__/sound-player.js"
export default class SoundPlayer {
  constructor() {
    console.log("Mock SoundPlayer: constructor was called");
  }

  playSoundFile() {
    console.log("Mock SoundPlayer: playSoundFile was called");
  }
}
```

### Mock using module factory parameter

The module factory function passed to `jest.mock(path, moduleFactory)` can be a HOF that returns a function\*. This will allow calling `new` on the mock. Again, this allows you to inject different behavior for testing, but does not provide a way to spy on calls.

#### \* Module factory function must return a function

In order to mock a constructor function, the module factory must return a constructor function. In other words, the module factory must be a function that returns a function - a higher-order function (HOF).

```javascript
jest.mock("./sound-player", () => {
  return function () {
    return { playSoundFile: () => {} };
  };
});
```

:::note

The mock can't be an arrow function because calling `new` on an arrow function is not allowed in JavaScript. So this won't work:

```javascript
jest.mock("./sound-player", () => {
  return () => {
    // Does not work; arrow functions can't be called with new
    return { playSoundFile: () => {} };
  };
});
```

This will throw **_TypeError: \_soundPlayer2.default is not a constructor_**, unless the code is transpiled to ES5, e.g. by `@babel/preset-env`. (ES5 doesn't have arrow functions nor classes, so both will be transpiled to plain functions.)

:::

## Mocking a specific method of a class

Lets say that you want to mock or spy on the method `playSoundFile` within the class `SoundPlayer`. A simple example:

```javascript
// your jest test file below
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";
import SoundPlayerConsumer from "./sound-player-consumer";

const playSoundFileMock = jest
  .spyOn(SoundPlayer.prototype, "playSoundFile")
  .mockImplementation(() => {
    console.log("mocked function");
  }); // comment this line if just want to "spy"

it("player consumer plays music", () => {
  const player = new SoundPlayerConsumer();
  player.playSomethingCool();
  expect(playSoundFileMock).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### Static, getter and setter methods

Lets imagine our class `SoundPlayer` has a getter method `foo` and a static method `brand`

```javascript
export default class SoundPlayer {
  constructor() {
    this.foo = "bar";
  }

  playSoundFile(fileName) {
    console.log("Playing sound file " + fileName);
  }

  get foo() {
    return "bar";
  }
  static brand() {
    return "player-brand";
  }
}
```

You can mock/spy on them easily, here is an example:

```javascript
// your jest test file below
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";

const staticMethodMock = jest
  .spyOn(SoundPlayer, "brand")
  .mockImplementation(() => "some-mocked-brand");

const getterMethodMock = jest
  .spyOn(SoundPlayer.prototype, "foo", "get")
  .mockImplementation(() => "some-mocked-result");

it("custom methods are called", () => {
  const player = new SoundPlayer();
  const foo = player.foo;
  const brand = SoundPlayer.brand();

  expect(staticMethodMock).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(getterMethodMock).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

## Keeping track of usage (spying on the mock)

Injecting a test implementation is helpful, but you will probably also want to test whether the class constructor and methods are called with the correct parameters.

### Spying on the constructor

In order to track calls to the constructor, replace the function returned by the HOF with a Jest mock function. Create it with [`jest.fn()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestfnimplementation), and then specify its implementation with `mockImplementation()`.

```javascript
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";
jest.mock("./sound-player", () => {
  // Works and lets you check for constructor calls:
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return { playSoundFile: () => {} };
  });
});
```

This will let us inspect usage of our mocked class, using `SoundPlayer.mock.calls`: `expect(SoundPlayer).toHaveBeenCalled();` or near-equivalent: `expect(SoundPlayer.mock.calls.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);`

### Mocking non-default class exports

If the class is **not** the default export from the module then you need to return an object with the key that is the same as the class export name.

```javascript
import { SoundPlayer } from "./sound-player";
jest.mock("./sound-player", () => {
  // Works and lets you check for constructor calls:
  return {
    SoundPlayer: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
      return { playSoundFile: () => {} };
    }),
  };
});
```

### Spying on methods of our class

Our mocked class will need to provide any member functions (`playSoundFile` in the example) that will be called during our tests, or else we'll get an error for calling a function that doesn't exist. But we'll probably want to also spy on calls to those methods, to ensure that they were called with the expected parameters.

A new object will be created each time the mock constructor function is called during tests. To spy on method calls in all of these objects, we populate `playSoundFile` with another mock function, and store a reference to that same mock function in our test file, so it's available during tests.

```javascript
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";
const mockPlaySoundFile = jest.fn();
jest.mock("./sound-player", () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return { playSoundFile: mockPlaySoundFile };
    // Now we can track calls to playSoundFile
  });
});
```

The manual mock equivalent of this would be:

```javascript title="__mocks__/sound-player.js"
// Import this named export into your test file
export const mockPlaySoundFile = jest.fn();
const mock = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
  return { playSoundFile: mockPlaySoundFile };
});

export default mock;
```

Usage is similar to the module factory function, except that you can omit the second argument from `jest.mock()`, and you must import the mocked method into your test file, since it is no longer defined there. Use the original module path for this; don't include `__mocks__`.

### Cleaning up between tests

To clear the record of calls to the mock constructor function and its methods, we call [`mockClear()`](MockFunctionAPI.md#mockfnmockclear) in the `beforeEach()` function:

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  SoundPlayer.mockClear();
  mockPlaySoundFile.mockClear();
});
```

## Complete example

Here's a complete test file which uses the module factory parameter to `jest.mock`:

```javascript title="sound-player-consumer.test.js"
import SoundPlayer from "./sound-player";
import SoundPlayerConsumer from "./sound-player-consumer";

const mockPlaySoundFile = jest.fn();
jest.mock("./sound-player", () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return { playSoundFile: mockPlaySoundFile };
  });
});

beforeEach(() => {
  SoundPlayer.mockClear();
  mockPlaySoundFile.mockClear();
});

it("The consumer should be able to call new() on SoundPlayer", () => {
  const soundPlayerConsumer = new SoundPlayerConsumer();
  // Ensure constructor created the object:
  expect(soundPlayerConsumer).toBeTruthy();
});

it("We can check if the consumer called the class constructor", () => {
  const soundPlayerConsumer = new SoundPlayerConsumer();
  expect(SoundPlayer).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});

it("We can check if the consumer called a method on the class instance", () => {
  const soundPlayerConsumer = new SoundPlayerConsumer();
  const coolSoundFileName = "song.mp3";
  soundPlayerConsumer.playSomethingCool();
  expect(mockPlaySoundFile.mock.calls[0][0]).toBe(coolSoundFileName);
});
```

title: Expect

When you're writing tests, you often need to check that values meet certain conditions. `expect` gives you access to a number of "matchers" that let you validate different things.

## Expect

### `expect(value)`

The `expect` function is used every time you want to test a value. You will rarely call `expect` by itself. Instead, you will use `expect` along with a "matcher" function to assert something about a value.

It's easier to understand this with an example. Let's say you have a method `bestLaCroixFlavor()` which is supposed to return the string `'grapefruit'`. Here's how you would test that:

```js
test("the best flavor is grapefruit", () => {
  expect(bestLaCroixFlavor()).toBe("grapefruit");
});
```

In this case, `toBe` is the matcher function. There are a lot of different matcher functions, documented below, to help you test different things.

The argument to `expect` should be the value that your code produces, and any argument to the matcher should be the correct value. If you mix them up, your tests will still work, but the error messages on failing tests will look strange.

## Modifiers

### `.not`

If you know how to test something, `.not` lets you test its opposite. For example, this code tests that the best La Croix flavor is not coconut:

```js
test("the best flavor is not coconut", () => {
  expect(bestLaCroixFlavor()).not.toBe("coconut");
});
```

### `.resolves`

Use `resolves` to unwrap the value of a fulfilled promise so any other matcher can be chained. If the promise is rejected the assertion fails.

For example, this code tests that the promise resolves and that the resulting value is `'lemon'`:

```js
test("resolves to lemon", () => {
  // make sure to add a return statement
  return expect(Promise.resolve("lemon")).resolves.toBe("lemon");
});
```

:::note

Since you are still testing promises, the test is still asynchronous. Hence, you will need to [tell Jest to wait](TestingAsyncCode.md#promises) by returning the unwrapped assertion.

Alternatively, you can use `async/await` in combination with `.resolves`:

```js
test("resolves to lemon", async () => {
  await expect(Promise.resolve("lemon")).resolves.toBe("lemon");
  await expect(Promise.resolve("lemon")).resolves.not.toBe("octopus");
});
```

:::

### `.rejects`

Use `.rejects` to unwrap the reason of a rejected promise so any other matcher can be chained. If the promise is fulfilled the assertion fails.

For example, this code tests that the promise rejects with reason `'octopus'`:

```js
test("rejects to octopus", () => {
  // make sure to add a return statement
  return expect(Promise.reject(new Error("octopus"))).rejects.toThrow(
    "octopus"
  );
});
```

:::note

Since you are still testing promises, the test is still asynchronous. Hence, you will need to [tell Jest to wait](TestingAsyncCode.md#promises) by returning the unwrapped assertion.

Alternatively, you can use `async/await` in combination with `.rejects`.

```js
test("rejects to octopus", async () => {
  await expect(Promise.reject(new Error("octopus"))).rejects.toThrow("octopus");
});
```

:::

## Matchers

### `.toBe(value)`

Use `.toBe` to compare primitive values or to check referential identity of object instances. It calls `Object.is` to compare values, which is even better for testing than `===` strict equality operator.

For example, this code will validate some properties of the `can` object:

```js
const can = {
  name: "pamplemousse",
  ounces: 12,
};

describe("the can", () => {
  test("has 12 ounces", () => {
    expect(can.ounces).toBe(12);
  });

  test("has a sophisticated name", () => {
    expect(can.name).toBe("pamplemousse");
  });
});
```

Don't use `.toBe` with floating-point numbers. For example, due to rounding, in JavaScript `0.2 + 0.1` is not strictly equal to `0.3`. If you have floating point numbers, try `.toBeCloseTo` instead.

Although the `.toBe` matcher **checks** referential identity, it **reports** a deep comparison of values if the assertion fails. If differences between properties do not help you to understand why a test fails, especially if the report is large, then you might move the comparison into the `expect` function. For example, to assert whether or not elements are the same instance:

- rewrite `expect(received).toBe(expected)` as `expect(Object.is(received, expected)).toBe(true)`
- rewrite `expect(received).not.toBe(expected)` as `expect(Object.is(received, expected)).toBe(false)`

### `.toHaveBeenCalled()`

Use `.toHaveBeenCalled` to ensure that a mock function was called.

For example, let's say you have a `drinkAll(drink, flavour)` function that takes a `drink` function and applies it to all available beverages. You might want to check that `drink` gets called. You can do that with this test suite:

```js
function drinkAll(callback, flavour) {
  if (flavour !== "octopus") {
    callback(flavour);
  }
}

describe("drinkAll", () => {
  test("drinks something lemon-flavoured", () => {
    const drink = jest.fn();
    drinkAll(drink, "lemon");
    expect(drink).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });

  test("does not drink something octopus-flavoured", () => {
    const drink = jest.fn();
    drinkAll(drink, "octopus");
    expect(drink).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

### `.toHaveBeenCalledTimes(number)`

Use `.toHaveBeenCalledTimes` to ensure that a mock function got called exact number of times.

For example, let's say you have a `drinkEach(drink, Array<flavor>)` function that takes a `drink` function and applies it to array of passed beverages. You might want to check that drink function was called exact number of times. You can do that with this test suite:

```js
test("drinkEach drinks each drink", () => {
  const drink = jest.fn();
  drinkEach(drink, ["lemon", "octopus"]);
  expect(drink).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
});
```

### `.toHaveBeenCalledWith(arg1, arg2, ...)`

Use `.toHaveBeenCalledWith` to ensure that a mock function was called with specific arguments. The arguments are checked with the same algorithm that `.toEqual` uses.

For example, let's say that you can register a beverage with a `register` function, and `applyToAll(f)` should apply the function `f` to all registered beverages. To make sure this works, you could write:

```js
test("registration applies correctly to orange La Croix", () => {
  const beverage = new LaCroix("orange");
  register(beverage);
  const f = jest.fn();
  applyToAll(f);
  expect(f).toHaveBeenCalledWith(beverage);
});
```

### `.toHaveBeenLastCalledWith(arg1, arg2, ...)`

If you have a mock function, you can use `.toHaveBeenLastCalledWith` to test what arguments it was last called with. For example, let's say you have a `applyToAllFlavors(f)` function that applies `f` to a bunch of flavors, and you want to ensure that when you call it, the last flavor it operates on is `'mango'`. You can write:

```js
test("applying to all flavors does mango last", () => {
  const drink = jest.fn();
  applyToAllFlavors(drink);
  expect(drink).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith("mango");
});
```

### `.toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(nthCall, arg1, arg2, ....)`

If you have a mock function, you can use `.toHaveBeenNthCalledWith` to test what arguments it was nth called with. For example, let's say you have a `drinkEach(drink, Array<flavor>)` function that applies `f` to a bunch of flavors, and you want to ensure that when you call it, the first flavor it operates on is `'lemon'` and the second one is `'octopus'`. You can write:

```js
test("drinkEach drinks each drink", () => {
  const drink = jest.fn();
  drinkEach(drink, ["lemon", "octopus"]);
  expect(drink).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(1, "lemon");
  expect(drink).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(2, "octopus");
});
```

:::note

The nth argument must be positive integer starting from 1.

:::

### `.toHaveReturned()`

If you have a mock function, you can use `.toHaveReturned` to test that the mock function successfully returned (i.e., did not throw an error) at least one time. For example, let's say you have a mock `drink` that returns `true`. You can write:

```js
test("drinks returns", () => {
  const drink = jest.fn(() => true);

  drink();

  expect(drink).toHaveReturned();
});
```

### `.toHaveReturnedTimes(number)`

Use `.toHaveReturnedTimes` to ensure that a mock function returned successfully (i.e., did not throw an error) an exact number of times. Any calls to the mock function that throw an error are not counted toward the number of times the function returned.

For example, let's say you have a mock `drink` that returns `true`. You can write:

```js
test("drink returns twice", () => {
  const drink = jest.fn(() => true);

  drink();
  drink();

  expect(drink).toHaveReturnedTimes(2);
});
```

### `.toHaveReturnedWith(value)`

Use `.toHaveReturnedWith` to ensure that a mock function returned a specific value.

For example, let's say you have a mock `drink` that returns the name of the beverage that was consumed. You can write:

```js
test("drink returns La Croix", () => {
  const beverage = { name: "La Croix" };
  const drink = jest.fn((beverage) => beverage.name);

  drink(beverage);

  expect(drink).toHaveReturnedWith("La Croix");
});
```

### `.toHaveLastReturnedWith(value)`

Use `.toHaveLastReturnedWith` to test the specific value that a mock function last returned. If the last call to the mock function threw an error, then this matcher will fail no matter what value you provided as the expected return value.

For example, let's say you have a mock `drink` that returns the name of the beverage that was consumed. You can write:

```js
test("drink returns La Croix (Orange) last", () => {
  const beverage1 = { name: "La Croix (Lemon)" };
  const beverage2 = { name: "La Croix (Orange)" };
  const drink = jest.fn((beverage) => beverage.name);

  drink(beverage1);
  drink(beverage2);

  expect(drink).toHaveLastReturnedWith("La Croix (Orange)");
});
```

### `.toHaveNthReturnedWith(nthCall, value)`

Use `.toHaveNthReturnedWith` to test the specific value that a mock function returned for the nth call. If the nth call to the mock function threw an error, then this matcher will fail no matter what value you provided as the expected return value.

For example, let's say you have a mock `drink` that returns the name of the beverage that was consumed. You can write:

```js
test("drink returns expected nth calls", () => {
  const beverage1 = { name: "La Croix (Lemon)" };
  const beverage2 = { name: "La Croix (Orange)" };
  const drink = jest.fn((beverage) => beverage.name);

  drink(beverage1);
  drink(beverage2);

  expect(drink).toHaveNthReturnedWith(1, "La Croix (Lemon)");
  expect(drink).toHaveNthReturnedWith(2, "La Croix (Orange)");
});
```

:::note

The nth argument must be positive integer starting from 1.

:::

### `.toHaveLength(number)`

Use `.toHaveLength` to check that an object has a `.length` property and it is set to a certain numeric value.

This is especially useful for checking arrays or strings size.

```js
expect([1, 2, 3]).toHaveLength(3);
expect("abc").toHaveLength(3);
expect("").not.toHaveLength(5);
```

### `.toHaveProperty(keyPath, value?)`

Use `.toHaveProperty` to check if property at provided reference `keyPath` exists for an object. For checking deeply nested properties in an object you may use [dot notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors) or an array containing the keyPath for deep references.

You can provide an optional `value` argument to compare the received property value (recursively for all properties of object instances, also known as deep equality, like the `toEqual` matcher).

The following example contains a `houseForSale` object with nested properties. We are using `toHaveProperty` to check for the existence and values of various properties in the object.

```js
// Object containing house features to be tested
const houseForSale = {
  bath: true,
  bedrooms: 4,
  kitchen: {
    amenities: ["oven", "stove", "washer"],
    area: 20,
    wallColor: "white",
    "nice.oven": true,
  },
  livingroom: {
    amenities: [
      {
        couch: [
          ["large", { dimensions: [20, 20] }],
          ["small", { dimensions: [10, 10] }],
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  "ceiling.height": 2,
};

test("this house has my desired features", () => {
  // Example Referencing
  expect(houseForSale).toHaveProperty("bath");
  expect(houseForSale).toHaveProperty("bedrooms", 4);

  expect(houseForSale).not.toHaveProperty("pool");

  // Deep referencing using dot notation
  expect(houseForSale).toHaveProperty("kitchen.area", 20);
  expect(houseForSale).toHaveProperty("kitchen.amenities", [
    "oven",
    "stove",
    "washer",
  ]);

  expect(houseForSale).not.toHaveProperty("kitchen.open");

  // Deep referencing using an array containing the keyPath
  expect(houseForSale).toHaveProperty(["kitchen", "area"], 20);
  expect(houseForSale).toHaveProperty(
    ["kitchen", "amenities"],
    ["oven", "stove", "washer"]
  );
  expect(houseForSale).toHaveProperty(["kitchen", "amenities", 0], "oven");
  expect(houseForSale).toHaveProperty(
    "livingroom.amenities[0].couch[0][1].dimensions[0]",
    20
  );
  expect(houseForSale).toHaveProperty(["kitchen", "nice.oven"]);
  expect(houseForSale).not.toHaveProperty(["kitchen", "open"]);

  // Referencing keys with dot in the key itself
  expect(houseForSale).toHaveProperty(["ceiling.height"], "tall");
});
```

### `.toBeCloseTo(number, numDigits?)`

Use `toBeCloseTo` to compare floating point numbers for approximate equality.

The optional `numDigits` argument limits the number of digits to check **after** the decimal point. For the default value `2`, the test criterion is `Math.abs(expected - received) < 0.005` (that is, `10 ** -2 / 2`).

Intuitive equality comparisons often fail, because arithmetic on decimal (base 10) values often have rounding errors in limited precision binary (base 2) representation. For example, this test fails:

```js
test("adding works sanely with decimals", () => {
  expect(0.2 + 0.1).toBe(0.3); // Fails!
});
```

It fails because in JavaScript, `0.2 + 0.1` is actually `0.30000000000000004`.

For example, this test passes with a precision of 5 digits:

```js
test("adding works sanely with decimals", () => {
  expect(0.2 + 0.1).toBeCloseTo(0.3, 5);
});
```

Because floating point errors are the problem that `toBeCloseTo` solves, it does not support big integer values.

### `.toBeDefined()`

Use `.toBeDefined` to check that a variable is not undefined. For example, if you want to check that a function `fetchNewFlavorIdea()` returns _something_, you can write:

```js
test("there is a new flavor idea", () => {
  expect(fetchNewFlavorIdea()).toBeDefined();
});
```

You could write `expect(fetchNewFlavorIdea()).not.toBe(undefined)`, but it's better practice to avoid referring to `undefined` directly in your code.

### `.toBeFalsy()`

Use `.toBeFalsy` when you don't care what a value is and you want to ensure a value is false in a boolean context. For example, let's say you have some application code that looks like:

```js
drinkSomeLaCroix();
if (!getErrors()) {
  drinkMoreLaCroix();
}
```

You may not care what `getErrors` returns, specifically - it might return `false`, `null`, or `0`, and your code would still work. So if you want to test there are no errors after drinking some La Croix, you could write:

```js
test("drinking La Croix does not lead to errors", () => {
  drinkSomeLaCroix();
  expect(getErrors()).toBeFalsy();
});
```

In JavaScript, there are six falsy values: `false`, `0`, `''`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`. Everything else is truthy.

### `.toBeGreaterThan(number | bigint)`

Use `toBeGreaterThan` to compare `received > expected` for number or big integer values. For example, test that `ouncesPerCan()` returns a value of more than 10 ounces:

```js
test("ounces per can is more than 10", () => {
  expect(ouncesPerCan()).toBeGreaterThan(10);
});
```

### `.toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(number | bigint)`

Use `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual` to compare `received >= expected` for number or big integer values. For example, test that `ouncesPerCan()` returns a value of at least 12 ounces:

```js
test("ounces per can is at least 12", () => {
  expect(ouncesPerCan()).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(12);
});
```

### `.toBeLessThan(number | bigint)`

Use `toBeLessThan` to compare `received < expected` for number or big integer values. For example, test that `ouncesPerCan()` returns a value of less than 20 ounces:

```js
test("ounces per can is less than 20", () => {
  expect(ouncesPerCan()).toBeLessThan(20);
});
```

### `.toBeLessThanOrEqual(number | bigint)`

Use `toBeLessThanOrEqual` to compare `received <= expected` for number or big integer values. For example, test that `ouncesPerCan()` returns a value of at most 12 ounces:

```js
test("ounces per can is at most 12", () => {
  expect(ouncesPerCan()).toBeLessThanOrEqual(12);
});
```

### `.toBeInstanceOf(Class)`

Use `.toBeInstanceOf(Class)` to check that an object is an instance of a class. This matcher uses `instanceof` underneath.

```js
class A {}

expect(new A()).toBeInstanceOf(A);
expect(() => {}).toBeInstanceOf(Function);
expect(new A()).toBeInstanceOf(Function); // throws
```

### `.toBeNull()`

`.toBeNull()` is the same as `.toBe(null)` but the error messages are a bit nicer. So use `.toBeNull()` when you want to check that something is null.

```js
function bloop() {
  return null;
}

test("bloop returns null", () => {
  expect(bloop()).toBeNull();
});
```

### `.toBeTruthy()`

Use `.toBeTruthy` when you don't care what a value is and you want to ensure a value is true in a boolean context. For example, let's say you have some application code that looks like:

```js
drinkSomeLaCroix();
if (thirstInfo()) {
  drinkMoreLaCroix();
}
```

You may not care what `thirstInfo` returns, specifically - it might return `true` or a complex object, and your code would still work. So if you want to test that `thirstInfo` will be truthy after drinking some La Croix, you could write:

```js
test("drinking La Croix leads to having thirst info", () => {
  drinkSomeLaCroix();
  expect(thirstInfo()).toBeTruthy();
});
```

In JavaScript, there are six falsy values: `false`, `0`, `''`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`. Everything else is truthy.

### `.toBeUndefined()`

Use `.toBeUndefined` to check that a variable is undefined. For example, if you want to check that a function `bestDrinkForFlavor(flavor)` returns `undefined` for the `'octopus'` flavor, because there is no good octopus-flavored drink:

```js
test("the best drink for octopus flavor is undefined", () => {
  expect(bestDrinkForFlavor("octopus")).toBeUndefined();
});
```

You could write `expect(bestDrinkForFlavor('octopus')).toBe(undefined)`, but it's better practice to avoid referring to `undefined` directly in your code.

### `.toBeNaN()`

Use `.toBeNaN` when checking a value is `NaN`.

```js
test("passes when value is NaN", () => {
  expect(NaN).toBeNaN();
  expect(1).not.toBeNaN();
});
```

### `.toContain(item)`

Use `.toContain` when you want to check that an item is in an array. For testing the items in the array, this uses `===`, a strict equality check. `.toContain` can also check whether a string is a substring of another string.

For example, if `getAllFlavors()` returns an array of flavors and you want to be sure that `lime` is in there, you can write:

```js
test("the flavor list contains lime", () => {
  expect(getAllFlavors()).toContain("lime");
});
```

This matcher also accepts others iterables such as strings, sets, node lists and HTML collections.

### `.toContainEqual(item)`

Use `.toContainEqual` when you want to check that an item with a specific structure and values is contained in an array. For testing the items in the array, this matcher recursively checks the equality of all fields, rather than checking for object identity.

```js
describe("my beverage", () => {
  test("is delicious and not sour", () => {
    const myBeverage = { delicious: true, sour: false };
    expect(myBeverages()).toContainEqual(myBeverage);
  });
});
```

### `.toEqual(value)`

Use `.toEqual` to compare recursively all properties of object instances (also known as "deep" equality). It calls `Object.is` to compare primitive values, which is even better for testing than `===` strict equality operator.

For example, `.toEqual` and `.toBe` behave differently in this test suite, so all the tests pass:

```js
const can1 = {
  flavor: "grapefruit",
  ounces: 12,
};
const can2 = {
  flavor: "grapefruit",
  ounces: 12,
};

describe("the La Croix cans on my desk", () => {
  test("have all the same properties", () => {
    expect(can1).toEqual(can2);
  });
  test("are not the exact same can", () => {
    expect(can1).not.toBe(can2);
  });
});
```

:::tip

`toEqual` ignores object keys with `undefined` properties, `undefined` array items, array sparseness, or object type mismatch. To take these into account use [`.toStrictEqual`](#tostrictequalvalue) instead.

:::

:::info

`.toEqual` won't perform a _deep equality_ check for two errors. Only the `message` property of an Error is considered for equality. It is recommended to use the `.toThrow` matcher for testing against errors.

:::

If differences between properties do not help you to understand why a test fails, especially if the report is large, then you might move the comparison into the `expect` function. For example, use `equals` method of `Buffer` class to assert whether or not buffers contain the same content:

- rewrite `expect(received).toEqual(expected)` as `expect(received.equals(expected)).toBe(true)`
- rewrite `expect(received).not.toEqual(expected)` as `expect(received.equals(expected)).toBe(false)`

### `.toMatch(regexp | string)`

Use `.toMatch` to check that a string matches a regular expression.

For example, you might not know what exactly `essayOnTheBestFlavor()` returns, but you know it's a really long string, and the substring `grapefruit` should be in there somewhere. You can test this with:

```js
describe("an essay on the best flavor", () => {
  test("mentions grapefruit", () => {
    expect(essayOnTheBestFlavor()).toMatch(/grapefruit/);
    expect(essayOnTheBestFlavor()).toMatch(new RegExp("grapefruit"));
  });
});
```

This matcher also accepts a string, which it will try to match:

```js
describe("grapefruits are healthy", () => {
  test("grapefruits are a fruit", () => {
    expect("grapefruits").toMatch("fruit");
  });
});
```

### `.toMatchObject(object)`

Use `.toMatchObject` to check that a JavaScript object matches a subset of the properties of an object. It will match received objects with properties that are **not** in the expected object.

You can also pass an array of objects, in which case the method will return true only if each object in the received array matches (in the `toMatchObject` sense described above) the corresponding object in the expected array. This is useful if you want to check that two arrays match in their number of elements, as opposed to `arrayContaining`, which allows for extra elements in the received array.

You can match properties against values or against matchers.

```js
const houseForSale = {
  bath: true,
  bedrooms: 4,
  kitchen: {
    amenities: ["oven", "stove", "washer"],
    area: 20,
    wallColor: "white",
  },
};
const desiredHouse = {
  bath: true,
  kitchen: {
    amenities: ["oven", "stove", "washer"],
    wallColor: expect.stringMatching(/white|yellow/),
  },
};

test("the house has my desired features", () => {
  expect(houseForSale).toMatchObject(desiredHouse);
});
```

```js
describe("toMatchObject applied to arrays", () => {
  test("the number of elements must match exactly", () => {
    expect([{ foo: "bar" }, { baz: 1 }]).toMatchObject([
      { foo: "bar" },
      { baz: 1 },
    ]);
  });

  test(".toMatchObject is called for each elements, so extra object properties are okay", () => {
    expect([{ foo: "bar" }, { baz: 1, extra: "quux" }]).toMatchObject([
      { foo: "bar" },
      { baz: 1 },
    ]);
  });
});
```

### `.toMatchSnapshot(propertyMatchers?, hint?)`

This ensures that a value matches the most recent snapshot. Check out [the Snapshot Testing guide](SnapshotTesting.md) for more information.

You can provide an optional `propertyMatchers` object argument, which has asymmetric matchers as values of a subset of expected properties, **if** the received value will be an **object** instance. It is like `toMatchObject` with flexible criteria for a subset of properties, followed by a snapshot test as exact criteria for the rest of the properties.

You can provide an optional `hint` string argument that is appended to the test name. Although Jest always appends a number at the end of a snapshot name, short descriptive hints might be more useful than numbers to differentiate **multiple** snapshots in a **single** `it` or `test` block. Jest sorts snapshots by name in the corresponding `.snap` file.

### `.toMatchInlineSnapshot(propertyMatchers?, inlineSnapshot)`

Ensures that a value matches the most recent snapshot.

You can provide an optional `propertyMatchers` object argument, which has asymmetric matchers as values of a subset of expected properties, **if** the received value will be an **object** instance. It is like `toMatchObject` with flexible criteria for a subset of properties, followed by a snapshot test as exact criteria for the rest of the properties.

Jest adds the `inlineSnapshot` string argument to the matcher in the test file (instead of an external `.snap` file) the first time that the test runs.

Check out the section on [Inline Snapshots](SnapshotTesting.md#inline-snapshots) for more info.

### `.toStrictEqual(value)`

Use `.toStrictEqual` to test that objects have the same structure and type.

Differences from `.toEqual`:

- keys with `undefined` properties are checked, e.g. `{a: undefined, b: 2}` will not equal `{b: 2}`;
- `undefined` items are taken into account, e.g. `[2]` will not equal `[2, undefined]`;
- array sparseness is checked, e.g. `[, 1]` will not equal `[undefined, 1]`;
- object types are checked, e.g. a class instance with fields `a` and `b` will not equal a literal object with fields `a` and `b`.

```js
class LaCroix {
  constructor(flavor) {
    this.flavor = flavor;
  }
}

describe("the La Croix cans on my desk", () => {
  test("are not semantically the same", () => {
    expect(new LaCroix("lemon")).toEqual({ flavor: "lemon" });
    expect(new LaCroix("lemon")).not.toStrictEqual({ flavor: "lemon" });
  });
});
```

### `.toThrow(error?)`

Use `.toThrow` to test that a function throws when it is called. For example, if we want to test that `drinkFlavor('octopus')` throws, because octopus flavor is too disgusting to drink, we could write:

```js
test("throws on octopus", () => {
  expect(() => {
    drinkFlavor("octopus");
  }).toThrow();
});
```

:::tip

You must wrap the code in a function, otherwise the error will not be caught and the assertion will fail.

:::

You can provide an optional argument to test that a specific error is thrown:

- regular expression: error message **matches** the pattern
- string: error message **includes** the substring
- error object: error message is **equal to** the message property of the object
- error class: error object is **instance of** class

For example, let's say that `drinkFlavor` is coded like this:

```js
function drinkFlavor(flavor) {
  if (flavor === "octopus") {
    throw new DisgustingFlavorError("yuck, octopus flavor");
  }
  // Do some other stuff
}
```

We could test this error gets thrown in several ways:

```js
test("throws on octopus", () => {
  function drinkOctopus() {
    drinkFlavor("octopus");
  }

  // Test that the error message says "yuck" somewhere: these are equivalent
  expect(drinkOctopus).toThrow(/yuck/);
  expect(drinkOctopus).toThrow("yuck");

  // Test the exact error message
  expect(drinkOctopus).toThrow(/^yuck, octopus flavor$/);
  expect(drinkOctopus).toThrow(new Error("yuck, octopus flavor"));

  // Test that we get a DisgustingFlavorError
  expect(drinkOctopus).toThrow(DisgustingFlavorError);
});
```

### `.toThrowErrorMatchingSnapshot(hint?)`

Use `.toThrowErrorMatchingSnapshot` to test that a function throws an error matching the most recent snapshot when it is called.

You can provide an optional `hint` string argument that is appended to the test name. Although Jest always appends a number at the end of a snapshot name, short descriptive hints might be more useful than numbers to differentiate **multiple** snapshots in a **single** `it` or `test` block. Jest sorts snapshots by name in the corresponding `.snap` file.

For example, let's say you have a `drinkFlavor` function that throws whenever the flavor is `'octopus'`, and is coded like this:

```js
function drinkFlavor(flavor) {
  if (flavor === "octopus") {
    throw new DisgustingFlavorError("yuck, octopus flavor");
  }
  // Do some other stuff
}
```

The test for this function will look this way:

```js
test("throws on octopus", () => {
  function drinkOctopus() {
    drinkFlavor("octopus");
  }

  expect(drinkOctopus).toThrowErrorMatchingSnapshot();
});
```

And it will generate the following snapshot:

```js
exports[`drinking flavors throws on octopus 1`] = `"yuck, octopus flavor"`;
```

Check out [React Tree Snapshot Testing](/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14) for more information on snapshot testing.

### `.toThrowErrorMatchingInlineSnapshot(inlineSnapshot)`

Use `.toThrowErrorMatchingInlineSnapshot` to test that a function throws an error matching the most recent snapshot when it is called.

Jest adds the `inlineSnapshot` string argument to the matcher in the test file (instead of an external `.snap` file) the first time that the test runs.

Check out the section on [Inline Snapshots](SnapshotTesting.md#inline-snapshots) for more info.

## Asymmetric Matchers

### `expect.anything()`

`expect.anything()` matches anything but `null` or `undefined`. You can use it inside `toEqual` or `toHaveBeenCalledWith` instead of a literal value. For example, if you want to check that a mock function is called with a non-null argument:

```js
test("map calls its argument with a non-null argument", () => {
  const mock = jest.fn();
  [1].map((x) => mock(x));
  expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.anything());
});
```

### `expect.any(constructor)`

`expect.any(constructor)` matches anything that was created with the given constructor or if it's a primitive that is of the passed type. You can use it inside `toEqual` or `toHaveBeenCalledWith` instead of a literal value. For example, if you want to check that a mock function is called with a number:

```js
class Cat {}
function getCat(fn) {
  return fn(new Cat());
}

test("randocall calls its callback with a class instance", () => {
  const mock = jest.fn();
  getCat(mock);
  expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.any(Cat));
});

function randocall(fn) {
  return fn(Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 + 1));
}

test("randocall calls its callback with a number", () => {
  const mock = jest.fn();
  randocall(mock);
  expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.any(Number));
});
```

### `expect.arrayContaining(array)`

`expect.arrayContaining(array)` matches a received array which contains all of the elements in the expected array. That is, the expected array is a **subset** of the received array. Therefore, it matches a received array which contains elements that are **not** in the expected array.

You can use it instead of a literal value:

- in `toEqual` or `toHaveBeenCalledWith`
- to match a property in `objectContaining` or `toMatchObject`

```js
describe("arrayContaining", () => {
  const expected = ["Alice", "Bob"];
  it("matches even if received contains additional elements", () => {
    expect(["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining(expected));
  });
  it("does not match if received does not contain expected elements", () => {
    expect(["Bob", "Eve"]).not.toEqual(expect.arrayContaining(expected));
  });
});
```

```js
describe("Beware of a misunderstanding! A sequence of dice rolls", () => {
  const expected = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  it("matches even with an unexpected number 7", () => {
    expect([4, 1, 6, 7, 3, 5, 2, 5, 4, 6]).toEqual(
      expect.arrayContaining(expected)
    );
  });
  it("does not match without an expected number 2", () => {
    expect([4, 1, 6, 7, 3, 5, 7, 5, 4, 6]).not.toEqual(
      expect.arrayContaining(expected)
    );
  });
});
```

### `expect.not.arrayContaining(array)`

`expect.not.arrayContaining(array)` matches a received array which does not contain all of the elements in the expected array. That is, the expected array **is not a subset** of the received array.

It is the inverse of `expect.arrayContaining`.

```js
describe("not.arrayContaining", () => {
  const expected = ["Samantha"];

  it("matches if the actual array does not contain the expected elements", () => {
    expect(["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]).toEqual(
      expect.not.arrayContaining(expected)
    );
  });
});
```

### `expect.closeTo(number, numDigits?)`

`expect.closeTo(number, numDigits?)` is useful when comparing floating point numbers in object properties or array item. If you need to compare a number, please use `.toBeCloseTo` instead.

The optional `numDigits` argument limits the number of digits to check **after** the decimal point. For the default value `2`, the test criterion is `Math.abs(expected - received) < 0.005 (that is, 10 ** -2 / 2)`.

For example, this test passes with a precision of 5 digits:

```js
test("compare float in object properties", () => {
  expect({
    title: "0.1 + 0.2",
    sum: 0.1 + 0.2,
  }).toEqual({
    title: "0.1 + 0.2",
    sum: expect.closeTo(0.3, 5),
  });
});
```

### `expect.objectContaining(object)`

`expect.objectContaining(object)` matches any received object that recursively matches the expected properties. That is, the expected object is a **subset** of the received object. Therefore, it matches a received object which contains properties that **are present** in the expected object.

Instead of literal property values in the expected object, you can use matchers, `expect.anything()`, and so on.

For example, let's say that we expect an `onPress` function to be called with an `Event` object, and all we need to verify is that the event has `event.x` and `event.y` properties. We can do that with:

```js
test("onPress gets called with the right thing", () => {
  const onPress = jest.fn();
  simulatePresses(onPress);
  expect(onPress).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.objectContaining({
      x: expect.any(Number),
      y: expect.any(Number),
    })
  );
});
```

### `expect.not.objectContaining(object)`

`expect.not.objectContaining(object)` matches any received object that does not recursively match the expected properties. That is, the expected object **is not a subset** of the received object. Therefore, it matches a received object which contains properties that are **not** in the expected object.

It is the inverse of `expect.objectContaining`.

```js
describe("not.objectContaining", () => {
  const expected = { foo: "bar" };

  it("matches if the actual object does not contain expected key: value pairs", () => {
    expect({ bar: "baz" }).toEqual(expect.not.objectContaining(expected));
  });
});
```

### `expect.stringContaining(string)`

`expect.stringContaining(string)` matches the received value if it is a string that contains the exact expected string.

### `expect.not.stringContaining(string)`

`expect.not.stringContaining(string)` matches the received value if it is not a string or if it is a string that does not contain the exact expected string.

It is the inverse of `expect.stringContaining`.

```js
describe("not.stringContaining", () => {
  const expected = "Hello world!";

  it("matches if the received value does not contain the expected substring", () => {
    expect("How are you?").toEqual(expect.not.stringContaining(expected));
  });
});
```

### `expect.stringMatching(string | regexp)`

`expect.stringMatching(string | regexp)` matches the received value if it is a string that matches the expected string or regular expression.

You can use it instead of a literal value:

- in `toEqual` or `toHaveBeenCalledWith`
- to match an element in `arrayContaining`
- to match a property in `objectContaining` or `toMatchObject`

This example also shows how you can nest multiple asymmetric matchers, with `expect.stringMatching` inside the `expect.arrayContaining`.

```js
describe("stringMatching in arrayContaining", () => {
  const expected = [
    expect.stringMatching(/^Alic/),
    expect.stringMatching(/^[BR]ob/),
  ];
  it("matches even if received contains additional elements", () => {
    expect(["Alicia", "Roberto", "Evelina"]).toEqual(
      expect.arrayContaining(expected)
    );
  });
  it("does not match if received does not contain expected elements", () => {
    expect(["Roberto", "Evelina"]).not.toEqual(
      expect.arrayContaining(expected)
    );
  });
});
```

### `expect.not.stringMatching(string | regexp)`

`expect.not.stringMatching(string | regexp)` matches the received value if it is not a string or if it is a string that does not match the expected string or regular expression.

It is the inverse of `expect.stringMatching`.

```js
describe("not.stringMatching", () => {
  const expected = /Hello world!/;

  it("matches if the received value does not match the expected regex", () => {
    expect("How are you?").toEqual(expect.not.stringMatching(expected));
  });
});
```

## Assertion Count

### `expect.assertions(number)`

`expect.assertions(number)` verifies that a certain number of assertions are called during a test. This is often useful when testing asynchronous code, in order to make sure that assertions in a callback actually got called.

For example, let's say that we have a function `doAsync` that receives two callbacks `callback1` and `callback2`, it will asynchronously call both of them in an unknown order. We can test this with:

```js
test("doAsync calls both callbacks", () => {
  expect.assertions(2);
  function callback1(data) {
    expect(data).toBeTruthy();
  }
  function callback2(data) {
    expect(data).toBeTruthy();
  }

  doAsync(callback1, callback2);
});
```

The `expect.assertions(2)` call ensures that both callbacks actually get called.

### `expect.hasAssertions()`

`expect.hasAssertions()` verifies that at least one assertion is called during a test. This is often useful when testing asynchronous code, in order to make sure that assertions in a callback actually got called.

For example, let's say that we have a few functions that all deal with state. `prepareState` calls a callback with a state object, `validateState` runs on that state object, and `waitOnState` returns a promise that waits until all `prepareState` callbacks complete. We can test this with:

```js
test("prepareState prepares a valid state", () => {
  expect.hasAssertions();
  prepareState((state) => {
    expect(validateState(state)).toBeTruthy();
  });
  return waitOnState();
});
```

The `expect.hasAssertions()` call ensures that the `prepareState` callback actually gets called.

## Extend Utilities

### `expect.addEqualityTesters(testers)`

You can use `expect.addEqualityTesters` to add your own methods to test if two objects are equal. For example, let's say you have a class in your code that represents volume and can determine if two volumes using different units are equal. You may want `toEqual` (and other equality matchers) to use this custom equality method when comparing to Volume classes. You can add a custom equality tester to have `toEqual` detect and apply custom logic when comparing Volume classes:

```js tab={"span":3} title="Volume.js"
// For simplicity in this example, we'll just support the units 'L' and 'mL'
export class Volume {
  constructor(amount, unit) {
    this.amount = amount;
    this.unit = unit;
  }

  toString() {
    return `[Volume ${this.amount}${this.unit}]`;
  }

  equals(other) {
    if (this.unit === other.unit) {
      return this.amount === other.amount;
    } else if (this.unit === "L" && other.unit === "mL") {
      return this.amount * 1000 === other.unit;
    } else {
      return this.amount === other.unit * 1000;
    }
  }
}
```

```js title="areVolumesEqual.js"
import { expect } from "@jest/globals";
import { Volume } from "./Volume.js";

function areVolumesEqual(a, b) {
  const isAVolume = a instanceof Volume;
  const isBVolume = b instanceof Volume;

  if (isAVolume && isBVolume) {
    return a.equals(b);
  } else if (isAVolume === isBVolume) {
    return undefined;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

expect.addEqualityTesters([areVolumesEqual]);
```

```js title="__tests__/Volume.test.js"
import { expect, test } from "@jest/globals";
import { Volume } from "../Volume.js";
import "../areVolumesEqual.js";

test("are equal with different units", () => {
  expect(new Volume(1, "L")).toEqual(new Volume(1000, "mL"));
});
```

```ts tab={"span":3} title="Volume.ts"
// For simplicity in this example, we'll just support the units 'L' and 'mL'
export class Volume {
  public amount: number;
  public unit: "L" | "mL";

  constructor(amount: number, unit: "L" | "mL") {
    this.amount = amount;
    this.unit = unit;
  }

  toString(): string {
    return `[Volume ${this.amount}${this.unit}]`;
  }

  equals(other: Volume): boolean {
    if (this.unit === other.unit) {
      return this.amount === other.amount;
    } else if (this.unit === "L" && other.unit === "mL") {
      return this.amount * 1000 === other.amount;
    } else {
      return this.amount === other.amount * 1000;
    }
  }
}
```

```ts title="areVolumesEqual.ts"
import { expect } from "@jest/globals";
import { Volume } from "./Volume.js";

function areVolumesEqual(a: unknown, b: unknown): boolean | undefined {
  const isAVolume = a instanceof Volume;
  const isBVolume = b instanceof Volume;

  if (isAVolume && isBVolume) {
    return a.equals(b);
  } else if (isAVolume === isBVolume) {
    return undefined;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

expect.addEqualityTesters([areVolumesEqual]);
```

```ts title="__tests__/Volume.test.ts"
import { expect, test } from "@jest/globals";
import { Volume } from "../Volume.js";
import "../areVolumesEqual.js";

test("are equal with different units", () => {
  expect(new Volume(1, "L")).toEqual(new Volume(1000, "mL"));
});
```

#### Custom equality testers API

Custom testers are functions that return either the result (`true` or `false`) of comparing the equality of the two given arguments or `undefined` if the tester does not handle the given objects and wants to delegate equality to other testers (for example, the builtin equality testers).

Custom testers are called with 3 arguments: the two objects to compare and the array of custom testers (used for recursive testers, see the section below).

These helper functions and properties can be found on `this` inside a custom tester:

#### `this.equals(a, b, customTesters?)`

This is a deep-equality function that will return `true` if two objects have the same values (recursively). It optionally takes a list of custom equality testers to apply to the deep equality checks. If you use this function, pass through the custom testers your tester is given so further equality checks `equals` applies can also use custom testers the test author may have configured. See the example in the [Recursive custom equality testers](#recursive-custom-equality-testers) section for more details.

#### Matchers vs Testers

Matchers are methods available on `expect`, for example `expect().toEqual()`. `toEqual` is a matcher. A tester is a method used by matchers that do equality checks to determine if objects are the same.

Custom matchers are good to use when you want to provide a custom assertion that test authors can use in their tests. For example, the `toBeWithinRange` example in the [`expect.extend`](#expectextendmatchers) section is a good example of a custom matcher. Sometimes a test author may want to assert two numbers are exactly equal and should use `toBe`. Other times, however, a test author may want to allow for some flexibility in their test, and `toBeWithinRange` may be a more appropriate assertion.

Custom equality testers are good for globally extending Jest matchers to apply custom equality logic for all equality comparisons. Test authors can't turn on custom testers for certain assertions and turn them off for others (a custom matcher should be used instead if that behavior is desired). For example, defining how to check if two `Volume` objects are equal for all matchers would be a good custom equality tester.

#### Recursive custom equality testers

If your custom equality testers are testing objects with properties you'd like to do deep equality with, you should use the `this.equals` helper available to equality testers. This `equals` method is the same deep equals method Jest uses internally for all of its deep equality comparisons. It's the method that invokes your custom equality tester. It accepts an array of custom equality testers as a third argument. Custom equality testers are also given an array of custom testers as their third argument. Pass this argument into the third argument of `equals` so that any further equality checks deeper into your object can also take advantage of custom equality testers.

For example, let's say you have a `Book` class that contains an array of `Author` classes and both of these classes have custom testers. The `Book` custom tester would want to do a deep equality check on the array of `Author`s and pass in the custom testers given to it, so the `Author`s custom equality tester is applied:

```js title="customEqualityTesters.js"
function areAuthorEqual(a, b) {
  const isAAuthor = a instanceof Author;
  const isBAuthor = b instanceof Author;

  if (isAAuthor && isBAuthor) {
    // Authors are equal if they have the same name
    return a.name === b.name;
  } else if (isAAuthor === isBAuthor) {
    return undefined;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

function areBooksEqual(a, b, customTesters) {
  const isABook = a instanceof Book;
  const isBBook = b instanceof Book;

  if (isABook && isBBook) {
    // Books are the same if they have the same name and author array. We need
    // to pass customTesters to equals here so the Author custom tester will be
    // used when comparing Authors
    return (
      a.name === b.name && this.equals(a.authors, b.authors, customTesters)
    );
  } else if (isABook === isBBook) {
    return undefined;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

expect.addEqualityTesters([areAuthorsEqual, areBooksEqual]);
```

:::note

Remember to define your equality testers as regular functions and **not** arrow functions in order to access the tester context helpers (e.g. `this.equals`).

:::

### `expect.addSnapshotSerializer(serializer)`

You can call `expect.addSnapshotSerializer` to add a module that formats application-specific data structures.

For an individual test file, an added module precedes any modules from `snapshotSerializers` configuration, which precede the default snapshot serializers for built-in JavaScript types and for React elements. The last module added is the first module tested.

```js
import serializer from "my-serializer-module";
expect.addSnapshotSerializer(serializer);

// affects expect(value).toMatchSnapshot() assertions in the test file
```

If you add a snapshot serializer in individual test files instead of adding it to `snapshotSerializers` configuration:

- You make the dependency explicit instead of implicit.
- You avoid limits to configuration that might cause you to eject from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

See [configuring Jest](Configuration.md#snapshotserializers-arraystring) for more information.

### `expect.extend(matchers)`

You can use `expect.extend` to add your own matchers to Jest. For example, let's say that you're testing a number utility library and you're frequently asserting that numbers appear within particular ranges of other numbers. You could abstract that into a `toBeWithinRange` matcher:

```js tab={"span":3} title="toBeWithinRange.js"
import { expect } from "@jest/globals";

function toBeWithinRange(actual, floor, ceiling) {
  if (
    typeof actual !== "number" ||
    typeof floor !== "number" ||
    typeof ceiling !== "number"
  ) {
    throw new TypeError("These must be of type number!");
  }

  const pass = actual >= floor && actual <= ceiling;
  if (pass) {
    return {
      message: () =>
        `expected ${this.utils.printReceived(
          actual
        )} not to be within range ${this.utils.printExpected(
          `${floor} - ${ceiling}`
        )}`,
      pass: true,
    };
  } else {
    return {
      message: () =>
        `expected ${this.utils.printReceived(
          actual
        )} to be within range ${this.utils.printExpected(
          `${floor} - ${ceiling}`
        )}`,
      pass: false,
    };
  }
}

expect.extend({
  toBeWithinRange,
});
```

```js title="__tests__/ranges.test.js"
import { expect, test } from "@jest/globals";
import "../toBeWithinRange";

test("is within range", () => expect(100).toBeWithinRange(90, 110));

test("is NOT within range", () => expect(101).not.toBeWithinRange(0, 100));

test("asymmetric ranges", () => {
  expect({ apples: 6, bananas: 3 }).toEqual({
    apples: expect.toBeWithinRange(1, 10),
    bananas: expect.not.toBeWithinRange(11, 20),
  });
});
```

```ts title="toBeWithinRange.d.ts"
// optionally add a type declaration, e.g. it enables autocompletion in IDEs
declare module "expect" {
  interface AsymmetricMatchers {
    toBeWithinRange(floor: number, ceiling: number): void;
  }
  interface Matchers<R> {
    toBeWithinRange(floor: number, ceiling: number): R;
  }
}

export {};
```

```ts tab={"span":2} title="toBeWithinRange.ts"
import { expect } from "@jest/globals";
import type { MatcherFunction } from "expect";

const toBeWithinRange: MatcherFunction<[floor: unknown, ceiling: unknown]> =
  // `floor` and `ceiling` get types from the line above
  // it is recommended to type them as `unknown` and to validate the values
  function (actual, floor, ceiling) {
    if (
      typeof actual !== "number" ||
      typeof floor !== "number" ||
      typeof ceiling !== "number"
    ) {
      throw new TypeError("These must be of type number!");
    }

    const pass = actual >= floor && actual <= ceiling;
    if (pass) {
      return {
        message: () =>
          // `this` context will have correct typings
          `expected ${this.utils.printReceived(
            actual
          )} not to be within range ${this.utils.printExpected(
            `${floor} - ${ceiling}`
          )}`,
        pass: true,
      };
    } else {
      return {
        message: () =>
          `expected ${this.utils.printReceived(
            actual
          )} to be within range ${this.utils.printExpected(
            `${floor} - ${ceiling}`
          )}`,
        pass: false,
      };
    }
  };

expect.extend({
  toBeWithinRange,
});

declare module "expect" {
  interface AsymmetricMatchers {
    toBeWithinRange(floor: number, ceiling: number): void;
  }
  interface Matchers<R> {
    toBeWithinRange(floor: number, ceiling: number): R;
  }
}
```

```ts tab title="__tests__/ranges.test.ts"
import { expect, test } from "@jest/globals";
import "../toBeWithinRange";

test("is within range", () => expect(100).toBeWithinRange(90, 110));

test("is NOT within range", () => expect(101).not.toBeWithinRange(0, 100));

test("asymmetric ranges", () => {
  expect({ apples: 6, bananas: 3 }).toEqual({
    apples: expect.toBeWithinRange(1, 10),
    bananas: expect.not.toBeWithinRange(11, 20),
  });
});
```

:::tip

The type declaration of the matcher can live in a `.d.ts` file or in an imported `.ts` module (see JS and TS examples above respectively). If you keep the declaration in a `.d.ts` file, make sure that it is included in the program and that it is a valid module, i.e. it has at least an empty `export {}`.

:::

:::tip

Instead of importing `toBeWithinRange` module to the test file, you can enable the matcher for all tests by moving the `expect.extend` call to a [`setupFilesAfterEnv`](Configuration.md#setupfilesafterenv-array) script:

```js
import { expect } from "@jest/globals";
// remember to export `toBeWithinRange` as well
import { toBeWithinRange } from "./toBeWithinRange";

expect.extend({
  toBeWithinRange,
});
```

:::

#### Async Matchers

`expect.extend` also supports async matchers. Async matchers return a Promise so you will need to await the returned value. Let's use an example matcher to illustrate the usage of them. We are going to implement a matcher called `toBeDivisibleByExternalValue`, where the divisible number is going to be pulled from an external source.

```js
expect.extend({
  async toBeDivisibleByExternalValue(received) {
    const externalValue = await getExternalValueFromRemoteSource();
    const pass = received % externalValue === 0;
    if (pass) {
      return {
        message: () =>
          `expected ${received} not to be divisible by ${externalValue}`,
        pass: true,
      };
    } else {
      return {
        message: () =>
          `expected ${received} to be divisible by ${externalValue}`,
        pass: false,
      };
    }
  },
});

test("is divisible by external value", async () => {
  await expect(100).toBeDivisibleByExternalValue();
  await expect(101).not.toBeDivisibleByExternalValue();
});
```

#### Custom Matchers API

Matchers should return an object (or a Promise of an object) with two keys. `pass` indicates whether there was a match or not, and `message` provides a function with no arguments that returns an error message in case of failure. Thus, when `pass` is false, `message` should return the error message for when `expect(x).yourMatcher()` fails. And when `pass` is true, `message` should return the error message for when `expect(x).not.yourMatcher()` fails.

Matchers are called with the argument passed to `expect(x)` followed by the arguments passed to `.yourMatcher(y, z)`:

```js
expect.extend({
  yourMatcher(x, y, z) {
    return {
      pass: true,
      message: () => "",
    };
  },
});
```

These helper functions and properties can be found on `this` inside a custom matcher:

#### `this.isNot`

A boolean to let you know this matcher was called with the negated `.not` modifier allowing you to display a clear and correct matcher hint (see example code).

#### `this.promise`

A string allowing you to display a clear and correct matcher hint:

- `'rejects'` if matcher was called with the promise `.rejects` modifier
- `'resolves'` if matcher was called with the promise `.resolves` modifier
- `''` if matcher was not called with a promise modifier

#### `this.equals(a, b, customTesters?)`

This is a deep-equality function that will return `true` if two objects have the same values (recursively). It optionally takes a list of custom equality testers to apply to the deep equality checks (see `this.customTesters` below).

#### `this.expand`

A boolean to let you know this matcher was called with an `expand` option. When Jest is called with the `--expand` flag, `this.expand` can be used to determine if Jest is expected to show full diffs and errors.

#### `this.utils`

There are a number of helpful tools exposed on `this.utils` primarily consisting of the exports from [`jest-matcher-utils`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/jest-matcher-utils).

The most useful ones are `matcherHint`, `printExpected` and `printReceived` to format the error messages nicely. For example, take a look at the implementation for the `toBe` matcher:

```js
const { diff } = require("jest-diff");
expect.extend({
  toBe(received, expected) {
    const options = {
      comment: "Object.is equality",
      isNot: this.isNot,
      promise: this.promise,
    };

    const pass = Object.is(received, expected);

    const message = pass
      ? () =>
          // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-template
          this.utils.matcherHint("toBe", undefined, undefined, options) +
          "\n\n" +
          `Expected: not ${this.utils.printExpected(expected)}\n` +
          `Received: ${this.utils.printReceived(received)}`
      : () => {
          const diffString = diff(expected, received, {
            expand: this.expand,
          });
          return (
            // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-template
            this.utils.matcherHint("toBe", undefined, undefined, options) +
            "\n\n" +
            (diffString && diffString.includes("- Expect")
              ? `Difference:\n\n${diffString}`
              : `Expected: ${this.utils.printExpected(expected)}\n` +
                `Received: ${this.utils.printReceived(received)}`)
          );
        };

    return { actual: received, message, pass };
  },
});
```

This will print something like this:

```bash
  expect(received).toBe(expected)

    Expected value to be (using Object.is):
      "banana"
    Received:
      "apple"
```

When an assertion fails, the error message should give as much signal as necessary to the user so they can resolve their issue quickly. You should craft a precise failure message to make sure users of your custom assertions have a good developer experience.

#### `this.customTesters`

If your matcher does a deep equality check using `this.equals`, you may want to pass user-provided custom testers to `this.equals`. The custom equality testers the user has provided using the `addEqualityTesters` API are available on this property. The built-in Jest matchers pass `this.customTesters` (along with other built-in testers) to `this.equals` to do deep equality, and your custom matchers may want to do the same.

#### Custom snapshot matchers

To use snapshot testing inside of your custom matcher you can import `jest-snapshot` and use it from within your matcher.

Here's a snapshot matcher that trims a string to store for a given length, `.toMatchTrimmedSnapshot(length)`:

```js
const { toMatchSnapshot } = require("jest-snapshot");

expect.extend({
  toMatchTrimmedSnapshot(received, length) {
    return toMatchSnapshot.call(
      this,
      received.slice(0, length),
      "toMatchTrimmedSnapshot"
    );
  },
});

it("stores only 10 characters", () => {
  expect("extra long string oh my gerd").toMatchTrimmedSnapshot(10);
});

/*
Stored snapshot will look like:

exports[`stores only 10 characters: toMatchTrimmedSnapshot 1`] = `"extra long"`;
*/
```

It's also possible to create custom matchers for inline snapshots, the snapshots will be correctly added to the custom matchers. However, inline snapshot will always try to append to the first argument or the second when the first argument is the property matcher, so it's not possible to accept custom arguments in the custom matchers.

```js
const { toMatchInlineSnapshot } = require("jest-snapshot");

expect.extend({
  toMatchTrimmedInlineSnapshot(received, ...rest) {
    return toMatchInlineSnapshot.call(this, received.slice(0, 10), ...rest);
  },
});

it("stores only 10 characters", () => {
  expect("extra long string oh my gerd").toMatchTrimmedInlineSnapshot();
  /*
  The snapshot will be added inline like
  expect('extra long string oh my gerd').toMatchTrimmedInlineSnapshot(
    `"extra long"`
  );
  */
});
```

#### async

If your custom inline snapshot matcher is async i.e. uses `async`-`await` you might encounter an error like "Multiple inline snapshots for the same call are not supported". Jest needs additional context information to find where the custom inline snapshot matcher was used to update the snapshots properly.

```js
const { toMatchInlineSnapshot } = require("jest-snapshot");

expect.extend({
  async toMatchObservationInlineSnapshot(fn, ...rest) {
    // The error (and its stacktrace) must be created before any `await`
    this.error = new Error();

    // The implementation of `observe` doesn't matter.
    // It only matters that the custom snapshot matcher is async.
    const observation = await observe(async () => {
      await fn();
    });

    return toMatchInlineSnapshot.call(this, recording, ...rest);
  },
});

it("observes something", async () => {
  await expect(async () => {
    return "async action";
  }).toMatchTrimmedInlineSnapshot();
  /*
  The snapshot will be added inline like
  await expect(async () => {
    return 'async action';
  }).toMatchTrimmedInlineSnapshot(`"async action"`);
  */
});
```

#### Bail out

Usually `jest` tries to match every snapshot that is expected in a test.

Sometimes it might not make sense to continue the test if a prior snapshot failed. For example, when you make snapshots of a state-machine after various transitions you can abort the test once one transition produced the wrong state.

In that case you can implement a custom snapshot matcher that throws on the first mismatch instead of collecting every mismatch.

```js
const { toMatchInlineSnapshot } = require("jest-snapshot");

expect.extend({
  toMatchStateInlineSnapshot(...args) {
    this.dontThrow = () => {};

    return toMatchInlineSnapshot.call(this, ...args);
  },
});

let state = "initial";

function transition() {
  // Typo in the implementation should cause the test to fail
  if (state === "INITIAL") {
    state = "pending";
  } else if (state === "pending") {
    state = "done";
  }
}

it("transitions as expected", () => {
  expect(state).toMatchStateInlineSnapshot(`"initial"`);

  transition();
  // Already produces a mismatch. No point in continuing the test.
  expect(state).toMatchStateInlineSnapshot(`"loading"`);

  transition();
  expect(state).toMatchStateInlineSnapshot(`"done"`);
});
```

## Serializable properties

### `SERIALIZABLE_PROPERTIES`

Serializable properties is a set of properties that are considered serializable by Jest. This set is used to determine if a property should be serializable or not. If an object has a property that is not in this set, it is considered not serializable and will not be printed in error messages.

You can add your own properties to this set to make sure that your objects are printed correctly. For example, if you have a `Volume` class, and you want to make sure that only the `amount` and `unit` properties are printed, you can add it to `SERIALIZABLE_PROPERTIES`:

```js
import { SERIALIZABLE_PROPERTIES } from "jest-matcher-utils";

class Volume {
  constructor(amount, unit) {
    this.amount = amount;
    this.unit = unit;
  }

  get label() {
    throw new Error("Not implemented");
  }
}

Volume.prototype[SERIALIZABLE_PROPERTIES] = ["amount", "unit"];

expect(new Volume(1, "L")).toEqual(new Volume(10, "L"));
```

This will print only the `amount` and `unit` properties in the error message, ignoring the `label` property.

```bash
expect(received).toEqual(expected) // deep equality

Expected: {"amount": 10, "unit": "L"}
Received: {"amount": 1, "unit": "L"}
```

id: getting-started
title: Getting Started
---

Install Jest using your favorite package manager:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Let's get started by writing a test for a hypothetical function that adds two numbers. First, create a `sum.js` file:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;
```

Then, create a file named `sum.test.js`. This will contain our actual test:

```javascript
const sum = require("./sum");

test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

Add the following section to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Finally, run `yarn test` or `npm test` and Jest will print this message:

```bash
PASS  ./sum.test.js
✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (5ms)
```

**You just successfully wrote your first test using Jest!**

This test used `expect` and `toBe` to test that two values were exactly identical. To learn about the other things that Jest can test, see [Using Matchers](UsingMatchers.md).

## Running from command line

You can run Jest directly from the CLI (if it's globally available in your `PATH`, e.g. by `yarn global add jest` or `npm install jest --global`) with a variety of useful options.

Here's how to run Jest on files matching `my-test`, using `config.json` as a configuration file and display a native OS notification after the run:

```bash
jest my-test --notify --config=config.json
```

If you'd like to learn more about running `jest` through the command line, take a look at the [Jest CLI Options](CLI.md) page.

## Additional Configuration

### Generate a basic configuration file

Based on your project, Jest will ask you a few questions and will create a basic configuration file with a short description for each option:

```bash npm2yarn
npm init jest@latest
```

### Using Babel

To use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), install required dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

Configure Babel to target your current version of Node by creating a `babel.config.js` file in the root of your project:

```javascript title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = {
  presets: [["@babel/preset-env", { targets: { node: "current" } }]],
};
```

The ideal configuration for Babel will depend on your project. See [Babel's docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) for more details.

<details>
  <summary markdown="span"><strong>Making your Babel config jest-aware</strong></summary>

Jest will set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `'test'` if it's not set to something else. You can use that in your configuration to conditionally setup only the compilation needed for Jest, e.g.

```javascript title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = (api) => {
  const isTest = api.env("test");
  // You can use isTest to determine what presets and plugins to use.

  return {
    // ...
  };
};
```

:::note

`babel-jest` is automatically installed when installing Jest and will automatically transform files if a babel configuration exists in your project. To avoid this behavior, you can explicitly reset the `transform` configuration option:

```javascript title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  transform: {},
};
```

:::

</details>

## Using with bundlers

Most of the time you do not need to do anything special to work with different bundlers - the exception is if you have some plugin or configuration which generates files or have custom file resolution rules.

### Using webpack

Jest can be used in projects that use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to manage assets, styles, and compilation. webpack does offer some unique challenges over other tools. Refer to the [webpack guide](Webpack.md) to get started.

### Using Vite

Jest is not supported by Vite due to incompatibilities with the Vite [plugin system](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/1955#issuecomment-776009094).

There are examples for Jest integration with Vite in the [vite-jest](https://github.com/sodatea/vite-jest) library. However, this library is not compatible with versions of Vite later than 2.4.2.

One alternative is [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) which has an API compatible Jest.

### Using Parcel

Jest can be used in projects that use [parcel-bundler](https://parceljs.org/) to manage assets, styles, and compilation similar to webpack. Parcel requires zero configuration. Refer to the official [docs](https://parceljs.org/docs/) to get started.

### Using TypeScript

#### Via `babel`

Jest supports TypeScript, via Babel. First, make sure you followed the instructions on [using Babel](#using-babel) above. Next, install the `@babel/preset-typescript`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript
```

Then add `@babel/preset-typescript` to the list of presets in your `babel.config.js`.

```javascript title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ["@babel/preset-env", { targets: { node: "current" } }],
    // highlight-next-line
    "@babel/preset-typescript",
  ],
};
```

However, there are some [caveats](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript#caveats) to using TypeScript with Babel. Because TypeScript support in Babel is purely transpilation, Jest will not type-check your tests as they are run. If you want that, you can use [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) instead, or just run the TypeScript compiler [tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) separately (or as part of your build process).

#### Via `ts-jest`

[ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) is a TypeScript preprocessor with source map support for Jest that lets you use Jest to test projects written in TypeScript.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev ts-jest
```

In order for Jest to transpile TypeScript with `ts-jest`, you may also need to create a [configuration](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/docs/getting-started/installation#jest-config-file) file.

#### Type definitions

There are two ways to have [Jest global APIs](GlobalAPI.md) typed for test files written in TypeScript.

You can use type definitions which ships with Jest and will update each time you update Jest. Install the `@jest/globals` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @jest/globals
```

And import the APIs from it:

```ts title="sum.test.ts"
import { describe, expect, test } from "@jest/globals";
import { sum } from "./sum";

describe("sum module", () => {
  test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
});
```

:::tip

See the additional usage documentation of [`describe.each`/`test.each`](GlobalAPI.md#typescript-usage) and [`mock functions`](MockFunctionAPI.md#typescript-usage).

:::

Or you may choose to install the [`@types/jest`](https://npmjs.com/package/@types/jest) package. It provides types for Jest globals without a need to import them.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @types/jest
```

:::info

`@types/jest` is a third party library maintained at [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/jest), hence the latest Jest features or versions may not be covered yet. Try to match versions of Jest and `@types/jest` as closely as possible. For example, if you are using Jest `27.4.0` then installing `27.4.x` of `@types/jest` is ideal.

:::

### Using ESLint

Jest can be used with ESLint without any further configuration as long as you import the [Jest global helpers](GlobalAPI.md) (`describe`, `it`, etc.) from `@jest/globals` before using them in your test file. This is necessary to avoid `no-undef` errors from ESLint, which doesn't know about the Jest globals.

If you'd like to avoid these imports, you can configure your [ESLint environment](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/language-options#specifying-environments) to support these globals by adding the `jest` environment:

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["tests/**/*"],
      "env": {
        "jest": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Or use [`eslint-plugin-jest`](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest), which has a similar effect:

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["tests/**/*"],
      "plugins": ["jest"],
      "env": {
        "jest/globals": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
````

In your test files, Jest puts each of these methods and objects into the global environment. You don't have to require or import anything to use them. However, if you prefer explicit imports, you can do `import {describe, expect, test} from '@jest/globals'`.

## Reference

### `afterAll(fn, timeout)`

Runs a function after all the tests in this file have completed. If the function returns a promise or is a generator, Jest waits for that promise to resolve before continuing.

Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

This is often useful if you want to clean up some global setup state that is shared across tests.

For example:

```js
const globalDatabase = makeGlobalDatabase();

function cleanUpDatabase(db) {
  db.cleanUp();
}

afterAll(() => {
  cleanUpDatabase(globalDatabase);
});

test("can find things", () => {
  return globalDatabase.find("thing", {}, (results) => {
    expect(results.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});

test("can insert a thing", () => {
  return globalDatabase.insert("thing", makeThing(), (response) => {
    expect(response.success).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

Here the `afterAll` ensures that `cleanUpDatabase` is called after all tests run.

If `afterAll` is inside a `describe` block, it runs at the end of the describe block.

If you want to run some cleanup after every test instead of after all tests, use `afterEach` instead.

### `afterEach(fn, timeout)`

Runs a function after each one of the tests in this file completes. If the function returns a promise or is a generator, Jest waits for that promise to resolve before continuing.

Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

This is often useful if you want to clean up some temporary state that is created by each test.

For example:

```js
const globalDatabase = makeGlobalDatabase();

function cleanUpDatabase(db) {
  db.cleanUp();
}

afterEach(() => {
  cleanUpDatabase(globalDatabase);
});

test("can find things", () => {
  return globalDatabase.find("thing", {}, (results) => {
    expect(results.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});

test("can insert a thing", () => {
  return globalDatabase.insert("thing", makeThing(), (response) => {
    expect(response.success).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

Here the `afterEach` ensures that `cleanUpDatabase` is called after each test runs.

If `afterEach` is inside a `describe` block, it only runs after the tests that are inside this describe block.

If you want to run some cleanup just once, after all of the tests run, use `afterAll` instead.

### `beforeAll(fn, timeout)`

Runs a function before any of the tests in this file run. If the function returns a promise or is a generator, Jest waits for that promise to resolve before running tests.

Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

This is often useful if you want to set up some global state that will be used by many tests.

For example:

```js
const globalDatabase = makeGlobalDatabase();

beforeAll(() => {
  // Clears the database and adds some testing data.
  // Jest will wait for this promise to resolve before running tests.
  return globalDatabase.clear().then(() => {
    return globalDatabase.insert({ testData: "foo" });
  });
});

// Since we only set up the database once in this example, it's important
// that our tests don't modify it.
test("can find things", () => {
  return globalDatabase.find("thing", {}, (results) => {
    expect(results.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

Here the `beforeAll` ensures that the database is set up before tests run. If setup was synchronous, you could do this without `beforeAll`. The key is that Jest will wait for a promise to resolve, so you can have asynchronous setup as well.

If `beforeAll` is inside a `describe` block, it runs at the beginning of the describe block.

If you want to run something before every test instead of before any test runs, use `beforeEach` instead.

### `beforeEach(fn, timeout)`

Runs a function before each of the tests in this file runs. If the function returns a promise or is a generator, Jest waits for that promise to resolve before running the test.

Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

This is often useful if you want to reset some global state that will be used by many tests.

For example:

```js
const globalDatabase = makeGlobalDatabase();

beforeEach(() => {
  // Clears the database and adds some testing data.
  // Jest will wait for this promise to resolve before running tests.
  return globalDatabase.clear().then(() => {
    return globalDatabase.insert({ testData: "foo" });
  });
});

test("can find things", () => {
  return globalDatabase.find("thing", {}, (results) => {
    expect(results.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});

test("can insert a thing", () => {
  return globalDatabase.insert("thing", makeThing(), (response) => {
    expect(response.success).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

Here the `beforeEach` ensures that the database is reset for each test.

If `beforeEach` is inside a `describe` block, it runs for each test in the describe block.

If you only need to run some setup code once, before any tests run, use `beforeAll` instead.

### `describe(name, fn)`

`describe(name, fn)` creates a block that groups together several related tests. For example, if you have a `myBeverage` object that is supposed to be delicious but not sour, you could test it with:

```js
const myBeverage = {
  delicious: true,
  sour: false,
};

describe("my beverage", () => {
  test("is delicious", () => {
    expect(myBeverage.delicious).toBeTruthy();
  });

  test("is not sour", () => {
    expect(myBeverage.sour).toBeFalsy();
  });
});
```

This isn't required - you can write the `test` blocks directly at the top level. But this can be handy if you prefer your tests to be organized into groups.

You can also nest `describe` blocks if you have a hierarchy of tests:

```js
const binaryStringToNumber = (binString) => {
  if (!/^[01]+$/.test(binString)) {
    throw new CustomError("Not a binary number.");
  }

  return parseInt(binString, 2);
};

describe("binaryStringToNumber", () => {
  describe("given an invalid binary string", () => {
    test("composed of non-numbers throws CustomError", () => {
      expect(() => binaryStringToNumber("abc")).toThrow(CustomError);
    });

    test("with extra whitespace throws CustomError", () => {
      expect(() => binaryStringToNumber("  100")).toThrow(CustomError);
    });
  });

  describe("given a valid binary string", () => {
    test("returns the correct number", () => {
      expect(binaryStringToNumber("100")).toBe(4);
    });
  });
});
```

### `describe.each(table)(name, fn, timeout)`

Use `describe.each` if you keep duplicating the same test suites with different data. `describe.each` allows you to write the test suite once and pass data in.

`describe.each` is available with two APIs:

#### 1. `describe.each(table)(name, fn, timeout)`

- `table`: `Array` of Arrays with the arguments that are passed into the `fn` for each row. If you pass in a 1D array of primitives, internally it will be mapped to a table i.e. `[1, 2, 3] -> [[1], [2], [3]]`.

- `name`: `String` the title of the test suite.
  - Generate unique test titles by positionally injecting parameters with [`printf` formatting](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_format_args):
    - `%p` - [pretty-format](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-format).
    - `%s`- String.
    - `%d`- Number.
    - `%i` - Integer.
    - `%f` - Floating point value.
    - `%j` - JSON.
    - `%o` - Object.
    - `%#` - Index of the test case.
    - `%$` - Number of the test case.
    - `%%` - single percent sign ('%'). This does not consume an argument.
  - Or generate unique test titles by injecting properties of test case object with `$variable`
    - To inject nested object values use you can supply a keyPath i.e. `$variable.path.to.value` (only works for ["own" properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty), e.g. `$variable.constructor.name` wouldn't work)
    - You can use `$#` to inject the index of the test case
    - You cannot use `$variable` with the `printf` formatting except for `%%`
- `fn`: `Function` the suite of tests to be run, this is the function that will receive the parameters in each row as function arguments.
- Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait for each row before aborting. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

Example:

```js
describe.each([
  [1, 1, 2],
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 1, 3],
])(".add(%i, %i)", (a, b, expected) => {
  test(`returns ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
  });

  test(`returned value not be greater than ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).not.toBeGreaterThan(expected);
  });

  test(`returned value not be less than ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).not.toBeLessThan(expected);
  });
});
```

```js
describe.each([
  { a: 1, b: 1, expected: 2 },
  { a: 1, b: 2, expected: 3 },
  { a: 2, b: 1, expected: 3 },
])(".add($a, $b)", ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  test(`returns ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
  });

  test(`returned value not be greater than ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).not.toBeGreaterThan(expected);
  });

  test(`returned value not be less than ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).not.toBeLessThan(expected);
  });
});
```

#### 2. `` describe.each`table`(name, fn, timeout) ``

- `table`: `Tagged Template Literal`
  - First row of variable name column headings separated with `|`
  - One or more subsequent rows of data supplied as template literal expressions using `${value}` syntax.
- `name`: `String` the title of the test suite, use `$variable` to inject test data into the suite title from the tagged template expressions, and `$#` for the index of the row.
  - To inject nested object values use you can supply a keyPath i.e. `$variable.path.to.value` (only works for ["own" properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty), e.g. `$variable.constructor.name` wouldn't work)
- `fn`: `Function` the suite of tests to be run, this is the function that will receive the test data object.
- Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait for each row before aborting. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

Example:

```js
describe.each`
  a    | b    | expected
  ${1} | ${1} | ${2}
  ${1} | ${2} | ${3}
  ${2} | ${1} | ${3}
`("$a + $b", ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  test(`returns ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
  });

  test(`returned value not be greater than ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).not.toBeGreaterThan(expected);
  });

  test(`returned value not be less than ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).not.toBeLessThan(expected);
  });
});
```

### `describe.only(name, fn)`

Also under the alias: `fdescribe(name, fn)`

You can use `describe.only` if you want to run only one describe block:

```js
describe.only("my beverage", () => {
  test("is delicious", () => {
    expect(myBeverage.delicious).toBeTruthy();
  });

  test("is not sour", () => {
    expect(myBeverage.sour).toBeFalsy();
  });
});

describe("my other beverage", () => {
  // ... will be skipped
});
```

### `describe.only.each(table)(name, fn)`

Also under the aliases: `fdescribe.each(table)(name, fn)` and `` fdescribe.each`table`(name, fn) ``

Use `describe.only.each` if you want to only run specific tests suites of data driven tests.

`describe.only.each` is available with two APIs:

#### `describe.only.each(table)(name, fn)`

```js
describe.only.each([
  [1, 1, 2],
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 1, 3],
])(".add(%i, %i)", (a, b, expected) => {
  test(`returns ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
  });
});

test("will not be run", () => {
  expect(1 / 0).toBe(Infinity);
});
```

#### `` describe.only.each`table`(name, fn) ``

```js
describe.only.each`
  a    | b    | expected
  ${1} | ${1} | ${2}
  ${1} | ${2} | ${3}
  ${2} | ${1} | ${3}
`("returns $expected when $a is added to $b", ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  test("passes", () => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
  });
});

test("will not be run", () => {
  expect(1 / 0).toBe(Infinity);
});
```

### `describe.skip(name, fn)`

Also under the alias: `xdescribe(name, fn)`

You can use `describe.skip` if you do not want to run the tests of a particular `describe` block:

```js
describe("my beverage", () => {
  test("is delicious", () => {
    expect(myBeverage.delicious).toBeTruthy();
  });

  test("is not sour", () => {
    expect(myBeverage.sour).toBeFalsy();
  });
});

describe.skip("my other beverage", () => {
  // ... will be skipped
});
```

Using `describe.skip` is often a cleaner alternative to temporarily commenting out a chunk of tests. Beware that the `describe` block will still run. If you have some setup that also should be skipped, do it in a `beforeAll` or `beforeEach` block.

### `describe.skip.each(table)(name, fn)`

Also under the aliases: `xdescribe.each(table)(name, fn)` and `` xdescribe.each`table`(name, fn) ``

Use `describe.skip.each` if you want to stop running a suite of data driven tests.

`describe.skip.each` is available with two APIs:

#### `describe.skip.each(table)(name, fn)`

```js
describe.skip.each([
  [1, 1, 2],
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 1, 3],
])(".add(%i, %i)", (a, b, expected) => {
  test(`returns ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected); // will not be run
  });
});

test("will be run", () => {
  expect(1 / 0).toBe(Infinity);
});
```

#### `` describe.skip.each`table`(name, fn) ``

```js
describe.skip.each`
  a    | b    | expected
  ${1} | ${1} | ${2}
  ${1} | ${2} | ${3}
  ${2} | ${1} | ${3}
`("returns $expected when $a is added to $b", ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  test("will not be run", () => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected); // will not be run
  });
});

test("will be run", () => {
  expect(1 / 0).toBe(Infinity);
});
```

### `test(name, fn, timeout)`

Also under the alias: `it(name, fn, timeout)`

All you need in a test file is the `test` method which runs a test. For example, let's say there's a function `inchesOfRain()` that should be zero. Your whole test could be:

```js
test("did not rain", () => {
  expect(inchesOfRain()).toBe(0);
});
```

The first argument is the test name; the second argument is a function that contains the expectations to test. The third argument (optional) is `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

If a **promise is returned** from `test`, Jest will wait for the promise to resolve before letting the test complete. For example, let's say `fetchBeverageList()` returns a promise that is supposed to resolve to a list that has `lemon` in it. You can test this with:

```js
test("has lemon in it", () => {
  return fetchBeverageList().then((list) => {
    expect(list).toContain("lemon");
  });
});
```

Even though the call to `test` will return right away, the test doesn't complete until the promise resolves. For more details, see [Testing Asynchronous Code](TestingAsyncCode.md) page.

:::tip

Jest will also wait if you **provide an argument to the test function**, usually called `done`. This could be handy when you want to test [callbacks](TestingAsyncCode.md#callbacks).

:::

### `test.concurrent(name, fn, timeout)`

Also under the alias: `it.concurrent(name, fn, timeout)`

:::caution

`test.concurrent` is considered experimental - see [here](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/labels/Area%3A%20Concurrent) for details on missing features and other issues.

:::

Use `test.concurrent` if you want the test to run concurrently.

The first argument is the test name; the second argument is an asynchronous function that contains the expectations to test. The third argument (optional) is `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

```js
test.concurrent("addition of 2 numbers", async () => {
  expect(5 + 3).toBe(8);
});

test.concurrent("subtraction 2 numbers", async () => {
  expect(5 - 3).toBe(2);
});
```

:::tip

Use the [`maxConcurrency`](Configuration.md#maxconcurrency-number) configuration option to prevent Jest from executing more than the specified amount of tests at the same time.

:::

### `test.concurrent.each(table)(name, fn, timeout)`

Also under the alias: `it.concurrent.each(table)(name, fn, timeout)`

Use `test.concurrent.each` if you keep duplicating the same test with different data. `test.each` allows you to write the test once and pass data in, the tests are all run asynchronously.

`test.concurrent.each` is available with two APIs:

#### 1. `test.concurrent.each(table)(name, fn, timeout)`

- `table`: `Array` of Arrays with the arguments that are passed into the test `fn` for each row. If you pass in a 1D array of primitives, internally it will be mapped to a table i.e. `[1, 2, 3] -> [[1], [2], [3]]`
- `name`: `String` the title of the test block.
  - Generate unique test titles by positionally injecting parameters with [`printf` formatting](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_format_args):
    - `%p` - [pretty-format](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-format).

    - `%d`- Number.
    - `%i` - Integer.
    - `%f` - Floating point value.
    - `%j` - JSON.
    - `%o` - Object.
    - `%#` - Index of the test case.
    - `%$` - Number of the test case.
    - `%%` - single percent sign ('%'). This does not consume an argument.
- `fn`: `Function` the test to be run, this is the function that will receive the parameters in each row as function arguments, **this will have to be an asynchronous function**.
- Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait for each row before aborting. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

`("returns $expected when $a is added to $b", async ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
});
```

### `test.concurrent.only.each(table)(name, fn)`

Also under the alias: `it.concurrent.only.each(table)(name, fn)`

Use `test.concurrent.only.each` if you want to only run specific tests with different test data concurrently.

`test.concurrent.only.each` is available with two APIs:

```

### `test.failing(name, fn, timeout)`

Also under the alias: `it.failing(name, fn, timeout)`

:::note

This is only available with the default [jest-circus](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/jest-circus) runner.

:::

Use `test.failing` when you are writing a test and expecting it to fail. These tests will behave the other way normal tests do. If `failing` test will throw any errors then it will pass. If it does not throw it will fail.

:::tip

You can use this type of test i.e. when writing code in a BDD way. In that case the tests will not show up as failing until they pass. Then you can just remove the `failing` modifier to make them pass.

It can also be a nice way to contribute failing tests to a project, even if you don't know how to fix the bug.

:::

Example:

```js
test.failing("it is not equal", () => {
  expect(5).toBe(6); // this test will pass
});

test.failing("it is equal", () => {
  expect(10).toBe(10); // this test will fail
});
```

### `test.failing.each(name, fn, timeout)`

Also under the alias: `it.failing.each(table)(name, fn)` and `` it.failing.each`table`(name, fn) ``

:::note

This is only available with the default [jest-circus](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/jest-circus) runner.

:::

You can also run multiple tests at once by adding `each` after `failing`.

Example:

```js
test.failing.each([
  { a: 1, b: 1, expected: 2 },
  { a: 1, b: 2, expected: 3 },
  { a: 2, b: 1, expected: 3 },
])(".add($a, $b)", ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
});
```

### `test.only.failing(name, fn, timeout)`

Also under the aliases: `it.only.failing(name, fn, timeout)`, `fit.failing(name, fn, timeout)`

:::note

This is only available with the default [jest-circus](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/jest-circus) runner.

:::

Use `test.only.failing` if you want to only run a specific failing test.

### `test.skip.failing(name, fn, timeout)`

Also under the aliases: `it.skip.failing(name, fn, timeout)`, `xit.failing(name, fn, timeout)`, `xtest.failing(name, fn, timeout)`

:::note

This is only available with the default [jest-circus](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/jest-circus) runner.

:::

Use `test.skip.failing` if you want to skip running a specific failing test.

### `test.only(name, fn, timeout)`

Also under the aliases: `it.only(name, fn, timeout)`, and `fit(name, fn, timeout)`

When you are debugging a large test file, you will often only want to run a subset of tests. You can use `.only` to specify which tests are the only ones you want to run in that test file.

Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting. The default timeout is 5 seconds.

For example, let's say you had these tests:

```js
test.only("it is raining", () => {
  expect(inchesOfRain()).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

test("it is not snowing", () => {
  expect(inchesOfSnow()).toBe(0);
});
```

Only the "it is raining" test will run in that test file, since it is run with `test.only`.

Usually you wouldn't check code using `test.only` into source control - you would use it for debugging, and remove it once you have fixed the broken tests.

### `test.only.each(table)(name, fn)`

Also under the aliases: `it.only.each(table)(name, fn)`, `fit.each(table)(name, fn)`, `` it.only.each`table`(name, fn) `` and `` fit.each`table`(name, fn) ``

Use `test.only.each` if you want to only run specific tests with different test data.

`test.only.each` is available with two APIs:

#### `test.only.each(table)(name, fn)`

```js
test.only.each([
  [1, 1, 2],
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 1, 3],
])(".add(%i, %i)", (a, b, expected) => {
  expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
});

test("will not be run", () => {
  expect(1 / 0).toBe(Infinity);
});
```

#### `` test.only.each`table`(name, fn) ``

```js
test.only.each`
  a    | b    | expected
  ${1} | ${1} | ${2}
  ${1} | ${2} | ${3}
  ${2} | ${1} | ${3}
`("returns $expected when $a is added to $b", ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
});

test("will not be run", () => {
  expect(1 / 0).toBe(Infinity);
});
```

### `test.skip(name, fn)`

Also under the aliases: `it.skip(name, fn)`, `xit(name, fn)`, and `xtest(name, fn)`

When you are maintaining a large codebase, you may sometimes find a test that is temporarily broken for some reason. If you want to skip running this test, but you don't want to delete this code, you can use `test.skip` to specify some tests to skip.

For example, let's say you had these tests:

```js
test("it is raining", () => {
  expect(inchesOfRain()).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

test.skip("it is not snowing", () => {
  expect(inchesOfSnow()).toBe(0);
});
```

Only the "it is raining" test will run, since the other test is run with `test.skip`.

You could comment the test out, but it's often a bit nicer to use `test.skip` because it will maintain indentation and syntax highlighting.

### `test.skip.each(table)(name, fn)`

Also under the aliases: `it.skip.each(table)(name, fn)`, `xit.each(table)(name, fn)`, `xtest.each(table)(name, fn)`, `` it.skip.each`table`(name, fn) ``, `` xit.each`table`(name, fn) `` and `` xtest.each`table`(name, fn) ``

Use `test.skip.each` if you want to stop running a collection of data driven tests.

`test.skip.each` is available with two APIs:

#### `test.skip.each(table)(name, fn)`

```js
test.skip.each([
  [1, 1, 2],
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 1, 3],
])(".add(%i, %i)", (a, b, expected) => {
  expect(a + b).toBe(expected); // will not be run
});

test("will be run", () => {
  expect(1 / 0).toBe(Infinity);
});
```

#### `` test.skip.each`table`(name, fn) ``

```js
test.skip.each`
  a    | b    | expected
  ${1} | ${1} | ${2}
  ${1} | ${2} | ${3}
  ${2} | ${1} | ${3}
`("returns $expected when $a is added to $b", ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  expect(a + b).toBe(expected); // will not be run
});

test("will be run", () => {
  expect(1 / 0).toBe(Infinity);
});
```

### `test.todo(name)`

Also under the alias: `it.todo(name)`

Use `test.todo` when you are planning on writing tests. These tests will be highlighted in the summary output at the end so you know how many tests you still need todo.

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

test.todo("add should be associative");
```

:::tip

`test.todo` will throw an error if you pass it a test callback function. Use [`test.skip`](#testskipname-fn) instead, if you already implemented the test, but do not want it to run.

:::

## TypeScript Usage

<TypeScriptExamplesNote />

### `.each`

The `.each` modifier offers few different ways to define a table of the test cases. Some of the APIs have caveats related with the type inference of the arguments which are passed to `describe` or `test` callback functions. Let's take a look at each of them.

:::note

For simplicity `test.each` is picked for the examples, but the type inference is identical in all cases where `.each` modifier can be used: `describe.each`, `test.concurrent.only.each`, `test.skip.each`, etc.

:::

#### Array of objects

The array of objects API is most verbose, but it makes the type inference a painless task. A `table` can be inlined:

```ts
import { test } from "@jest/globals";

test.each([
  { name: "a", path: "path/to/a", count: 1, write: true },
  { name: "b", path: "path/to/b", count: 3 },
])("inline table", ({ name, path, count, write }) => {
  // arguments are typed as expected, e.g. `write: boolean | undefined`
});
```

Or declared separately as a variable:

```ts
import { test } from "@jest/globals";

const table = [
  { a: 1, b: 2, expected: "three", extra: true },
  { a: 3, b: 4, expected: "seven", extra: false },
  { a: 5, b: 6, expected: "eleven" },
];

test.each(table)("table as a variable", ({ a, b, expected, extra }) => {
  // again everything is typed as expected, e.g. `extra: boolean | undefined`
});
```

#### Array of arrays

The array of arrays style will work smoothly with inlined tables:

```ts
import { test } from "@jest/globals";

test.each([
  [1, 2, "three", true],
  [3, 4, "seven", false],
  [5, 6, "eleven"],
])("inline table example", (a, b, expected, extra) => {
  // arguments are typed as expected, e.g. `extra: boolean | undefined`
});
```

However, if a table is declared as a separate variable, it must be typed as an array of tuples for correct type inference (this is not needed only if all elements of a row are of the same type):

```ts
import { test } from "@jest/globals";

const table: Array<[number, number, string, boolean?]> = [
  [1, 2, "three", true],
  [3, 4, "seven", false],
  [5, 6, "eleven"],
];

test.each(table)("table as a variable example", (a, b, expected, extra) => {
  // without the annotation types are incorrect, e.g. `a: number | string | boolean`
});
```

#### Template literal

If all input values are of the same type, the template literal API will type the arguments correctly:

```ts
import { test } from "@jest/globals";

test.each`
  a    | b    | expected
  ${1} | ${2} | ${3}
  ${3} | ${4} | ${7}
  ${5} | ${6} | ${11}
`("template literal example same type", ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  // all arguments are of type `number` because all inputs (a, b, expected) are of type `number`
});
```

If the inputs have different types, the arguments will be typed as a union of all the input types (i.e. type of the variables inside the template literal):

```ts
import { test } from "@jest/globals";

test.each`
  a    | b    | expected
  ${1} | ${2} | ${"three"}
  ${3} | ${4} | ${"seven"}
  ${5} | ${6} | ${"eleven"}
`("template literal example different types", ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  // all arguments are of type `number | string` because some inputs (a, b) are of type `number` and some others (expected) are of type `string`
});
```

Otherwise, if you want each argument to have the right type, you have to explicitly provide the generic type argument:

```ts
import { test } from "@jest/globals";

test.each<{ a: number; b: number; expected: string; extra?: boolean }>`
  a    | b    | expected    | extra
  ${1} | ${2} | ${"three"}  | ${true}
  ${3} | ${4} | ${"seven"}  | ${false}
  ${5} | ${6} | ${"eleven"}
`("template literal example", ({ a, b, expected, extra }) => {
  // all arguments are typed as expected, e.g. `a: number`, `expected: string`, `extra: boolean | undefined`
});
```

:::caution

Keep in mind the variables inside the template literal are not type checked, so you have to ensure that their types are correct.

```ts
import { test } from "@jest/globals";

test.each<{ a: number; expected: string }>`
  a                            | expected
  ${1}                         | ${"one"}
  ${"will not raise TS error"} | ${"two"}
  ${3}                         | ${"three"}
`("template literal with wrongly typed input", ({ a, expected }) => {
  // all arguments are typed as stated in the generic: `a: number`, `expected: string`
  // WARNING: `a` is of type `number` but will be a string in the 2nd test case.
});
```

title: The Jest Object

The `jest` object is automatically in scope within every test file. The methods in the `jest` object help create mocks and let you control Jest's overall behavior. It can also be imported explicitly by via `import {jest} from '@jest/globals'`.

## Mock Modules

### `jest.disableAutomock()`

Disables automatic mocking in the module loader.

:::info

Automatic mocking should be enabled via [`automock`](Configuration.md#automock-boolean) configuration option for this method to have any effect. Also see documentation of the configuration option for more details.

```js tab
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const config = {
  automock: true,
};

module.exports = config;
```

```ts tab
import type { Config } from "jest";

const config: Config = {
  automock: true,
};

export default config;
```

:::

After `disableAutomock()` is called, all `require()`s will return the real versions of each module (rather than a mocked version).

```js title="utils.js"
export default {
  authorize: () => {
    return "token";
  },
};
```

```js title="__tests__/disableAutomocking.js"
import utils from "../utils";

jest.disableAutomock();

test("original implementation", () => {
  // now we have the original implementation,
  // even if we set the automocking in a jest configuration
  expect(utils.authorize()).toBe("token");
});
```

This is usually useful when you have a scenario where the number of dependencies you want to mock is far less than the number of dependencies that you don't. For example, if you're writing a test for a module that uses a large number of dependencies that can be reasonably classified as "implementation details" of the module, then you likely do not want to mock them.

Examples of dependencies that might be considered "implementation details" are things ranging from language built-ins (e.g. `Array.prototype` methods) to highly common utility methods (e.g. `underscore`, `lodash`, array utilities, etc) and entire libraries like `React.js`.

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

:::tip

When using `babel-jest`, calls to `disableAutomock()` will automatically be hoisted to the top of the code block. Use `autoMockOff()` if you want to explicitly avoid this behavior.

:::

### `jest.enableAutomock()`

Enables automatic mocking in the module loader.

:::info

For more details on automatic mocking see documentation of [`automock`](Configuration.md#automock-boolean) configuration option.

:::

Example:

```js title="utils.js"
export default {
  authorize: () => {
    return "token";
  },
  isAuthorized: (secret) => secret === "wizard",
};
```

```js title="__tests__/enableAutomocking.js"
jest.enableAutomock();

import utils from "../utils";

test("original implementation", () => {
  // now we have the mocked implementation,
  expect(utils.authorize._isMockFunction).toBeTruthy();
  expect(utils.isAuthorized._isMockFunction).toBeTruthy();
});
```

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

:::tip

When using `babel-jest`, calls to `enableAutomock` will automatically be hoisted to the top of the code block. Use `autoMockOn` if you want to explicitly avoid this behavior.

:::

### `jest.createMockFromModule(moduleName)`

Given the name of a module, use the automatic mocking system to generate a mocked version of the module for you.

This is useful when you want to create a [manual mock](ManualMocks.md) that extends the automatic mock's behavior:

```js tab={"span":2} title="utils.js"
module.exports = {
  authorize: () => {
    return "token";
  },
  isAuthorized: (secret) => secret === "wizard",
};
```

```js title="__tests__/createMockFromModule.test.js"
const utils = jest.createMockFromModule("../utils");

utils.isAuthorized = jest.fn((secret) => secret === "not wizard");

test("implementation created by jest.createMockFromModule", () => {
  expect(jest.isMockFunction(utils.authorize)).toBe(true);
  expect(utils.isAuthorized("not wizard")).toBe(true);
});
```

```ts tab={"span":2} title="utils.ts"
export const utils = {
  authorize: () => {
    return "token";
  },
  isAuthorized: (secret: string) => secret === "wizard",
};
```

```ts title="__tests__/createMockFromModule.test.ts"
const { utils } =
  jest.createMockFromModule<typeof import("../utils")>("../utils");

utils.isAuthorized = jest.fn((secret: string) => secret === "not wizard");

test("implementation created by jest.createMockFromModule", () => {
  expect(jest.isMockFunction(utils.authorize)).toBe(true);
  expect(utils.isAuthorized("not wizard")).toBe(true);
});
```

This is how `createMockFromModule` will mock the following data types:

#### `Function`

Creates a new [mock function](MockFunctionAPI.md). The new function has no formal parameters and when called will return `undefined`. This functionality also applies to `async` functions.

#### `Class`

Creates a new class. The interface of the original class is maintained, all of the class member functions and properties will be mocked.

#### `Object`

Creates a new deeply cloned object. The object keys are maintained and their values are mocked.

#### `Array`

Creates a new empty array, ignoring the original.

#### `Primitives`

Creates a new property with the same primitive value as the original property.

Example:

```js title="example.js"
module.exports = {
  function: function square(a, b) {
    return a * b;
  },
  asyncFunction: async function asyncSquare(a, b) {
    const result = (await a) * b;
    return result;
  },
  class: new (class Bar {
    constructor() {
      this.array = [1, 2, 3];
    }
    foo() {}
  })(),
  object: {
    baz: "foo",
    bar: {
      fiz: 1,
      buzz: [1, 2, 3],
    },
  },
  array: [1, 2, 3],
  number: 123,
  string: "baz",
  boolean: true,
  symbol: Symbol.for("a.b.c"),
};
```

```js title="__tests__/example.test.js"
const example = jest.createMockFromModule("../example");

test("should run example code", () => {
  // creates a new mocked function with no formal arguments.
  expect(example.function.name).toBe("square");
  expect(example.function).toHaveLength(0);

  // async functions get the same treatment as standard synchronous functions.
  expect(example.asyncFunction.name).toBe("asyncSquare");
  expect(example.asyncFunction).toHaveLength(0);

  // creates a new class with the same interface, member functions and properties are mocked.
  expect(example.class.constructor.name).toBe("Bar");
  expect(example.class.foo.name).toBe("foo");
  expect(example.class.array).toHaveLength(0);

  // creates a deeply cloned version of the original object.
  expect(example.object).toEqual({
    baz: "foo",
    bar: {
      fiz: 1,
      buzz: [],
    },
  });

  // creates a new empty array, ignoring the original array.
  expect(example.array).toHaveLength(0);

  // creates a new property with the same primitive value as the original property.
  expect(example.number).toBe(123);
  expect(example.string).toBe("baz");
  expect(example.boolean).toBe(true);
  expect(example.symbol).toEqual(Symbol.for("a.b.c"));
});
```

### `jest.mock(moduleName, factory, options)`

Mocks a module with an auto-mocked version when it is being required. `factory` and `options` are optional. For example:

```js title="banana.js"
module.exports = () => "banana";
```

```js title="__tests__/test.js"
jest.mock("../banana");

const banana = require("../banana"); // banana will be explicitly mocked.

banana(); // will return 'undefined' because the function is auto-mocked.
```

The second argument can be used to specify an explicit module factory that is being run instead of using Jest's automocking feature:

```js tab
jest.mock("../moduleName", () => {
  return jest.fn(() => 42);
});

// This runs the function specified as second argument to `jest.mock`.
const moduleName = require("../moduleName");
moduleName(); // Will return '42';
```

```ts tab
// The optional type argument provides typings for the module factory
jest.mock<typeof import("../moduleName")>("../moduleName", () => {
  return jest.fn(() => 42);
});

// This runs the function specified as second argument to `jest.mock`.
const moduleName = require("../moduleName");
moduleName(); // Will return '42';
```

When using the `factory` parameter for an ES6 module with a default export, the `__esModule: true` property needs to be specified. This property is normally generated by Babel / TypeScript, but here it needs to be set manually. When importing a default export, it's an instruction to import the property named `default` from the export object:

```js
import moduleName, { foo } from "../moduleName";

jest.mock("../moduleName", () => {
  return {
    __esModule: true,
    default: jest.fn(() => 42),
    foo: jest.fn(() => 43),
  };
});

moduleName(); // Will return 42
foo(); // Will return 43
```

The third argument can be used to create virtual mocks – mocks of modules that don't exist anywhere in the system:

```js
jest.mock(
  "../moduleName",
  () => {
    /*
     * Custom implementation of a module that doesn't exist in JS,
     * like a generated module or a native module in react-native.
     */
  },
  { virtual: true }
);
```

:::caution

Importing a module in a setup file (as specified by [`setupFilesAfterEnv`](Configuration.md#setupfilesafterenv-array)) will prevent mocking for the module in question, as well as all the modules that it imports.

:::

Modules that are mocked with `jest.mock` are mocked only for the file that calls `jest.mock`. Another file that imports the module will get the original implementation even if it runs after the test file that mocks the module.

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

:::tip

Writing tests in TypeScript? Use the [`jest.Mocked`](MockFunctionAPI.md#jestmockedsource) utility type or the [`jest.mocked()`](MockFunctionAPI.md#jestmockedsource-options) helper method to have your mocked modules typed.

:::

### `jest.Mocked<Source>`

See [TypeScript Usage](MockFunctionAPI.md#jestmockedsource) chapter of Mock Functions page for documentation.

### `jest.mocked(source, options?)`

See [TypeScript Usage](MockFunctionAPI.md#jestmockedsource-options) chapter of Mock Functions page for documentation.

### `jest.unmock(moduleName)`

Indicates that the module system should never return a mocked version of the specified module from `require()` (e.g. that it should always return the real module).

The most common use of this API is for specifying the module a given test intends to be testing (and thus doesn't want automatically mocked).

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

### `jest.deepUnmock(moduleName)`

Indicates that the module system should never return a mocked version of the specified module and its dependencies.

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

### `jest.doMock(moduleName, factory, options)`

When using `babel-jest`, calls to `mock` will automatically be hoisted to the top of the code block. Use this method if you want to explicitly avoid this behavior.

One example when this is useful is when you want to mock a module differently within the same file:

```js tab
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.resetModules();
});

test("moduleName 1", () => {
  jest.doMock("../moduleName", () => {
    return jest.fn(() => 1);
  });
  const moduleName = require("../moduleName");
  expect(moduleName()).toBe(1);
});

test("moduleName 2", () => {
  jest.doMock("../moduleName", () => {
    return jest.fn(() => 2);
  });
  const moduleName = require("../moduleName");
  expect(moduleName()).toBe(2);
});
```

```ts tab
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.resetModules();
});

test("moduleName 1", () => {
  // The optional type argument provides typings for the module factory
  jest.doMock<typeof import("../moduleName")>("../moduleName", () => {
    return jest.fn(() => 1);
  });
  const moduleName = require("../moduleName");
  expect(moduleName()).toBe(1);
});

test("moduleName 2", () => {
  jest.doMock<typeof import("../moduleName")>("../moduleName", () => {
    return jest.fn(() => 2);
  });
  const moduleName = require("../moduleName");
  expect(moduleName()).toBe(2);
});
```

Using `jest.doMock()` with ES6 imports requires additional steps. Follow these if you don't want to use `require` in your tests:

- We have to specify the `__esModule: true` property (see the [`jest.mock()`](#jestmockmodulename-factory-options) API for more information).
- Static ES6 module imports are hoisted to the top of the file, so instead we have to import them dynamically using `import()`.
- Finally, we need an environment which supports dynamic importing. Please see [Using Babel](GettingStarted.md#using-babel) for the initial setup. Then add the plugin [babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node), or an equivalent, to your Babel config to enable dynamic importing in Node.

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.resetModules();
});

test("moduleName 1", () => {
  jest.doMock("../moduleName", () => {
    return {
      __esModule: true,
      default: "default1",
      foo: "foo1",
    };
  });
  return import("../moduleName").then((moduleName) => {
    expect(moduleName.default).toBe("default1");
    expect(moduleName.foo).toBe("foo1");
  });
});

test("moduleName 2", () => {
  jest.doMock("../moduleName", () => {
    return {
      __esModule: true,
      default: "default2",
      foo: "foo2",
    };
  });
  return import("../moduleName").then((moduleName) => {
    expect(moduleName.default).toBe("default2");
    expect(moduleName.foo).toBe("foo2");
  });
});
```

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

### `jest.dontMock(moduleName)`

When using `babel-jest`, calls to `unmock` will automatically be hoisted to the top of the code block. Use this method if you want to explicitly avoid this behavior.

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

### `jest.setMock(moduleName, moduleExports)`

Explicitly supplies the mock object that the module system should return for the specified module.

On occasion, there are times where the automatically generated mock the module system would normally provide you isn't adequate enough for your testing needs. Normally under those circumstances you should write a [manual mock](ManualMocks.md) that is more adequate for the module in question. However, on extremely rare occasions, even a manual mock isn't suitable for your purposes and you need to build the mock yourself inside your test.

In these rare scenarios you can use this API to manually fill the slot in the module system's mock-module registry.

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

:::info

It is recommended to use [`jest.mock()`](#jestmockmodulename-factory-options) instead. The `jest.mock` API's second argument is a module factory instead of the expected exported module object.

:::

### `jest.requireActual(moduleName)`

Returns the actual module instead of a mock, bypassing all checks on whether the module should receive a mock implementation or not.

```js tab
jest.mock("../myModule", () => {
  // Require the original module to not be mocked...
  const originalModule = jest.requireActual("../myModule");

  return {
    __esModule: true, // Use it when dealing with esModules
    ...originalModule,
    getRandom: jest.fn(() => 10),
  };
});

const getRandom = require("../myModule").getRandom;

getRandom(); // Always returns 10
```

```ts tab
jest.mock("../myModule", () => {
  // Require the original module to not be mocked...
  const originalModule =
    jest.requireActual<typeof import("../myModule")>("../myModule");

  return {
    __esModule: true, // Use it when dealing with esModules
    ...originalModule,
    getRandom: jest.fn(() => 10),
  };
});

const getRandom = require("../myModule").getRandom;

getRandom(); // Always returns 10
```

### `jest.requireMock(moduleName)`

Returns a mock module instead of the actual module, bypassing all checks on whether the module should be required normally or not.

### `jest.onGenerateMock(cb)`

Registers a callback function that is invoked whenever Jest generates a mock for a module. This callback allows you to modify the mock before it is returned to the rest of your tests.

Parameters for callback:

1. `modulePath: string` - The absolute path to the module that is being mocked.
2. `moduleMock: T` - The mock object that Jest has generated for the module. This object can be modified or replaced before returning.

Behaviour:

- If multiple callbacks are registered via consecutive `onGenerateMock` calls, they will be invoked **in the order they were added**.
- Each callback receives the output of the previous callback as its `moduleMock`. This makes it possible to apply multiple layers of transformations to the same mock.

```js
jest.onGenerateMock((modulePath, moduleMock) => {
  // Inspect the module name and decide how to transform the mock
  if (modulePath.includes("Database")) {
    // For demonstration, let's replace a method with our own custom mock
    moduleMock.connect = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
      console.log("Connected to mock DB");
    });
  }

  // Return the (potentially modified) mock
  return moduleMock;
});

// Apply mock for module
jest.mock("./Database");

// Later in your tests
import Database from "./Database";
// The `Database` mock now has any transformations applied by our callback
```

:::note

The `onGenerateMock` callback is not called for manually created mocks, such as:

- Mocks defined in a `__mocks__` folder
- Explicit factories provided via `jest.mock('moduleName', () => { ... })`

:::

### `jest.resetModules()`

Resets the module registry - the cache of all required modules. This is useful to isolate modules where local state might conflict between tests.

Example:

```js
const sum1 = require("../sum");
jest.resetModules();
const sum2 = require("../sum");
sum1 === sum2;
// > false (Both sum modules are separate "instances" of the sum module.)
```

Example in a test:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.resetModules();
});

test("works", () => {
  const sum = require("../sum");
});

test("works too", () => {
  const sum = require("../sum");
  // sum is a different copy of the sum module from the previous test.
});
```

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

### `jest.isolateModules(fn)`

`jest.isolateModules(fn)` goes a step further than `jest.resetModules()` and creates a sandbox registry for the modules that are loaded inside the callback function. This is useful to isolate specific modules for every test so that local module state doesn't conflict between tests.

```js
let myModule;
jest.isolateModules(() => {
  myModule = require("myModule");
});

const otherCopyOfMyModule = require("myModule");
```

### `jest.isolateModulesAsync(fn)`

`jest.isolateModulesAsync()` is the equivalent of `jest.isolateModules()`, but for async callbacks. The caller is expected to `await` the completion of `isolateModulesAsync`.

```js
let myModule;
await jest.isolateModulesAsync(async () => {
  myModule = await import("myModule");
  // do async stuff here
});

const otherCopyOfMyModule = await import("myModule");
```

## Mock Functions

### `jest.fn(implementation?)`

Returns a new, unused [mock function](MockFunctionAPI.md). Optionally takes a mock implementation.

```js
const mockFn = jest.fn();
mockFn();
expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled();

// With a mock implementation:
const returnsTrue = jest.fn(() => true);
console.log(returnsTrue()); // true;
```

:::tip

See the [Mock Functions](MockFunctionAPI.md#jestfnimplementation) page for details on TypeScript usage.

:::

### `jest.isMockFunction(fn)`

Determines if the given function is a mocked function.

### `jest.replaceProperty(object, propertyKey, value)`

Replace `object[propertyKey]` with a `value`. The property must already exist on the object. The same property might be replaced multiple times. Returns a Jest [replaced property](MockFunctionAPI.md#replaced-properties).

:::note

To mock properties that are defined as getters or setters, use [`jest.spyOn(object, methodName, accessType)`](#jestspyonobject-methodname-accesstype) instead. To mock functions, use [`jest.spyOn(object, methodName)`](#jestspyonobject-methodname) instead.

:::

:::tip

All properties replaced with `jest.replaceProperty` could be restored to the original value by calling [jest.restoreAllMocks](#jestrestoreallmocks) on [afterEach](GlobalAPI.md#aftereachfn-timeout) method.

:::

Example:

```js
const utils = {
  isLocalhost() {
    return process.env.HOSTNAME === "localhost";
  },
};

module.exports = utils;
```

Example test:

```js
const utils = require("./utils");

afterEach(() => {
  // restore replaced property
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
});

test("isLocalhost returns true when HOSTNAME is localhost", () => {
  jest.replaceProperty(process, "env", { HOSTNAME: "localhost" });
  expect(utils.isLocalhost()).toBe(true);
});

test("isLocalhost returns false when HOSTNAME is not localhost", () => {
  jest.replaceProperty(process, "env", { HOSTNAME: "not-localhost" });
  expect(utils.isLocalhost()).toBe(false);
});
```

### `jest.spyOn(object, methodName)`

Creates a mock function similar to `jest.fn` but also tracks calls to `object[methodName]`. Returns a Jest [mock function](MockFunctionAPI.md).

:::note

By default, `jest.spyOn` also calls the **spied** method. This is different behavior from most other test libraries. If you want to overwrite the original function, you can use `jest.spyOn(object, methodName).mockImplementation(() => customImplementation)` or `object[methodName] = jest.fn(() => customImplementation)`.

:::

:::tip

Since `jest.spyOn` is a mock, you could restore the initial state by calling [`jest.restoreAllMocks`](#jestrestoreallmocks) in the body of the callback passed to the [afterEach](GlobalAPI.md#aftereachfn-timeout) hook.

:::

Example:

```js
const video = {
  play() {
    return true;
  },
};

module.exports = video;
```

Example test:

```js
const video = require("./video");

afterEach(() => {
  // restore the spy created with spyOn
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
});

test("plays video", () => {
  const spy = jest.spyOn(video, "play");
  const isPlaying = video.play();

  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(isPlaying).toBe(true);
});
```

#### Spied methods and the `using` keyword

If your codebase is set up to transpile the ["explicit resource management"](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management) (e.g. if you are using TypeScript >= 5.2 or the `@babel/plugin-proposal-explicit-resource-management` plugin), you can use `spyOn` in combination with the `using` keyword:

```js
test('logs a warning', () => {
  using spy = jest.spyOn(console.warn);
  doSomeThingWarnWorthy();
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

That code is semantically equal to

```js
test("logs a warning", () => {
  let spy;
  try {
    spy = jest.spyOn(console.warn);
    doSomeThingWarnWorthy();
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
  } finally {
    spy.mockRestore();
  }
});
```

That way, your spy will automatically be restored to the original value once the current code block is left.

You can even go a step further and use a code block to restrict your mock to only a part of your test without hurting readability.

```js
test('testing something', () => {
  {
    using spy = jest.spyOn(console.warn);
    setupStepThatWillLogAWarning();
  }
  // here, console.warn is already restored to the original value
  // your test can now continue normally
});
```

:::note

If you get a warning that `Symbol.dispose` does not exist, you might need to polyfill that, e.g. with this code:

```js
if (!Symbol.dispose) {
  Object.defineProperty(Symbol, "dispose", {
    get() {
      return Symbol.for("nodejs.dispose");
    },
  });
}
```

:::

### `jest.spyOn(object, methodName, accessType?)`

Since Jest 22.1.0+, the `jest.spyOn` method takes an optional third argument of `accessType` that can be either `'get'` or `'set'`, which proves to be useful when you want to spy on a getter or a setter, respectively.

Example:

```js
const video = {
  // it's a getter!
  get play() {
    return true;
  },
};

module.exports = video;

const audio = {
  _volume: false,
  // it's a setter!
  set volume(value) {
    this._volume = value;
  },
  get volume() {
    return this._volume;
  },
};

module.exports = audio;
```

Example test:

```js
const audio = require("./audio");
const video = require("./video");

afterEach(() => {
  // restore the spy created with spyOn
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
});

test("plays video", () => {
  const spy = jest.spyOn(video, "play", "get"); // we pass 'get'
  const isPlaying = video.play;

  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(isPlaying).toBe(true);
});

test("plays audio", () => {
  const spy = jest.spyOn(audio, "volume", "set"); // we pass 'set'
  audio.volume = 100;

  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(audio.volume).toBe(100);
});
```

### `jest.Replaced<Source>`

See [TypeScript Usage](MockFunctionAPI.md#replacedpropertyreplacevaluevalue) chapter of Mock Functions page for documentation.

### `jest.Spied<Source>`

See [TypeScript Usage](MockFunctionAPI.md#jestspiedsource) chapter of Mock Functions page for documentation.

### `jest.clearAllMocks()`

Clears the `mock.calls`, `mock.instances`, `mock.contexts` and `mock.results` properties of all mocks. Equivalent to calling [`.mockClear()`](MockFunctionAPI.md#mockfnmockclear) on every mocked function.

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

### `jest.resetAllMocks()`

Resets the state of all mocks. Equivalent to calling [`.mockReset()`](MockFunctionAPI.md#mockfnmockreset) on every mocked function.

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

### `jest.restoreAllMocks()`

Restores all mocks and replaced properties back to their original value. Equivalent to calling [`.mockRestore()`](MockFunctionAPI.md#mockfnmockrestore) on every mocked function and [`.restore()`](MockFunctionAPI.md#replacedpropertyrestore) on every replaced property. Beware that `jest.restoreAllMocks()` only works for mocks created with [`jest.spyOn()`](#jestspyonobject-methodname) and properties replaced with [`jest.replaceProperty()`](#jestreplacepropertyobject-propertykey-value); other mocks will require you to manually restore them.

## Fake Timers

### `jest.useFakeTimers(fakeTimersConfig?)`

Instructs Jest to use fake versions of the global date, performance, time and timer APIs. Fake timers implementation is backed by [`@sinonjs/fake-timers`](https://github.com/sinonjs/fake-timers).

Fake timers will swap out `Date`, `performance.now()`, `queueMicrotask()`, `setImmediate()`, `clearImmediate()`, `setInterval()`, `clearInterval()`, `setTimeout()`, `clearTimeout()` with an implementation that gets its time from the fake clock.

In Node environment `process.hrtime`, `process.nextTick()` and in JSDOM environment `requestAnimationFrame()`, `cancelAnimationFrame()`, `requestIdleCallback()`, `cancelIdleCallback()` will be replaced as well.

Configuration options:

```ts
type FakeableAPI =
  | "Date"
  | "hrtime"
  | "nextTick"
  | "performance"
  | "queueMicrotask"
  | "requestAnimationFrame"
  | "cancelAnimationFrame"
  | "requestIdleCallback"
  | "cancelIdleCallback"
  | "setImmediate"
  | "clearImmediate"
  | "setInterval"
  | "clearInterval"
  | "setTimeout"
  | "clearTimeout";

type FakeTimersConfig = {
  /**
   * If set to `true` all timers will be advanced automatically by 20 milliseconds
   * every 20 milliseconds. A custom time delta may be provided by passing a number.
   * The default is `false`.
   */
  advanceTimers?: boolean | number;
  /**
   * List of names of APIs that should not be faked. The default is `[]`, meaning
   * all APIs are faked.
   */
  doNotFake?: Array<FakeableAPI>;
  /**
   * Use the old fake timers implementation instead of one backed by `@sinonjs/fake-timers`.
   * The default is `false`.
   */
  legacyFakeTimers?: boolean;
  /** Sets current system time to be used by fake timers, in milliseconds. The default is `Date.now()`. */
  now?: number | Date;
  /**
   * The maximum number of recursive timers that will be run when calling `jest.runAllTimers()`.
   * The default is `100_000` timers.
   */
  timerLimit?: number;
};
```

Calling `jest.useFakeTimers()` will use fake timers for all tests within the file, until original timers are restored with `jest.useRealTimers()`.

You can call `jest.useFakeTimers()` or `jest.useRealTimers()` from anywhere: top level, inside an `test` block, etc. Keep in mind that this is a **global operation** and will affect other tests within the same file. Calling `jest.useFakeTimers()` once again in the same test file would reset the internal state (e.g. timer count) and reinstall fake timers using the provided options:

```js
test("advance the timers automatically", () => {
  jest.useFakeTimers({ advanceTimers: true });
  // ...
});

test("do not advance the timers and do not fake `performance`", () => {
  jest.useFakeTimers({ doNotFake: ["performance"] });
  // ...
});

test("uninstall fake timers for the rest of tests in the file", () => {
  jest.useRealTimers();
  // ...
});
```

:::info Legacy Fake Timers

For some reason you might have to use legacy implementation of fake timers. It can be enabled like this (additional options are not supported):

```js
jest.useFakeTimers({
  legacyFakeTimers: true,
});
```

Legacy fake timers will swap out `setImmediate()`, `clearImmediate()`, `setInterval()`, `clearInterval()`, `setTimeout()`, `clearTimeout()` with Jest [mock functions](MockFunctionAPI.md). In Node environment `process.nextTick()` and in JSDOM environment `requestAnimationFrame()`, `cancelAnimationFrame()` will be also replaced.

:::

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

### `jest.useRealTimers()`

Instructs Jest to restore the original implementations of the global date, performance, time and timer APIs. For example, you may call `jest.useRealTimers()` inside `afterEach` hook to restore timers after each test:

```js
afterEach(() => {
  jest.useRealTimers();
});

test("do something with fake timers", () => {
  jest.useFakeTimers();
  // ...
});

test("do something with real timers", () => {
  // ...
});
```

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

### `jest.runAllTicks()`

Exhausts the **micro**-task queue (usually interfaced in node via `process.nextTick`).

When this API is called, all pending micro-tasks that have been queued via `process.nextTick` will be executed. Additionally, if those micro-tasks themselves schedule new micro-tasks, those will be continually exhausted until there are no more micro-tasks remaining in the queue.

### `jest.runAllTimers()`

Exhausts both the **macro**-task queue (i.e., all tasks queued by `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, and `setImmediate()`) and the **micro**-task queue (usually interfaced in node via `process.nextTick`).

When this API is called, all pending macro-tasks and micro-tasks will be executed. If those tasks themselves schedule new tasks, those will be continually exhausted until there are no more tasks remaining in the queue.

This is often useful for synchronously executing setTimeouts during a test in order to synchronously assert about some behavior that would only happen after the `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()` callbacks executed. See the [Timer mocks](TimerMocks.md) doc for more information.

### `jest.runAllTimersAsync()`

Asynchronous equivalent of `jest.runAllTimers()`. It allows any scheduled promise callbacks to execute _before_ running the timers.

:::info

This function is not available when using legacy fake timers implementation.

:::

### `jest.runAllImmediates()`

Exhausts all tasks queued by `setImmediate()`.

:::info

This function is only available when using legacy fake timers implementation.

:::

### `jest.advanceTimersByTime(msToRun)`

Executes only the macro task queue (i.e. all tasks queued by `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()` and `setImmediate()`).

When this API is called, all timers are advanced by `msToRun` milliseconds. All pending "macro-tasks" that have been queued via `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`, and would be executed within this time frame will be executed. Additionally, if those macro-tasks schedule new macro-tasks that would be executed within the same time frame, those will be executed until there are no more macro-tasks remaining in the queue, that should be run within `msToRun` milliseconds.

### `jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(msToRun)`

Asynchronous equivalent of `jest.advanceTimersByTime(msToRun)`. It allows any scheduled promise callbacks to execute _before_ running the timers.

:::info

This function is not available when using legacy fake timers implementation.

:::

### `jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()`

Executes only the macro-tasks that are currently pending (i.e., only the tasks that have been queued by `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()` up to this point). If any of the currently pending macro-tasks schedule new macro-tasks, those new tasks will not be executed by this call.

This is useful for scenarios such as one where the module being tested schedules a `setTimeout()` whose callback schedules another `setTimeout()` recursively (meaning the scheduling never stops). In these scenarios, it's useful to be able to run forward in time by a single step at a time.

### `jest.runOnlyPendingTimersAsync()`

Asynchronous equivalent of `jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()`. It allows any scheduled promise callbacks to execute _before_ running the timers.

:::info

This function is not available when using legacy fake timers implementation.

:::

### `jest.advanceTimersToNextTimer(steps)`

Advances all timers by the needed milliseconds so that only the next timeouts/intervals will run.

Optionally, you can provide `steps`, so it will run `steps` amount of next timeouts/intervals.

### `jest.advanceTimersToNextTimerAsync(steps)`

Asynchronous equivalent of `jest.advanceTimersToNextTimer(steps)`. It allows any scheduled promise callbacks to execute _before_ running the timers.

:::info

This function is not available when using legacy fake timers implementation.

:::

### `jest.advanceTimersToNextFrame()`

Advances all timers by the needed milliseconds to execute callbacks currently scheduled with `requestAnimationFrame`. `advanceTimersToNextFrame()` is a helpful way to execute code that is scheduled using `requestAnimationFrame`.

:::info

This function is not available when using legacy fake timers implementation.

:::

### `jest.clearAllTimers()`

Removes any pending timers from the timer system.

This means, if any timers have been scheduled (but have not yet executed), they will be cleared and will never have the opportunity to execute in the future.

### `jest.getTimerCount()`

Returns the number of fake timers still left to run.

### `jest.now()`

Returns the time in ms of the current clock. This is equivalent to `Date.now()` if real timers are in use, or if `Date` is mocked. In other cases (such as legacy timers) it may be useful for implementing custom mocks of `Date.now()`, `performance.now()`, etc.

### `jest.setSystemTime(now?: number | Date)`

Set the current system time used by fake timers. Simulates a user changing the system clock while your program is running. It affects the current time but it does not in itself cause e.g. timers to fire; they will fire exactly as they would have done without the call to `jest.setSystemTime()`.

:::info

This function is not available when using legacy fake timers implementation.

:::

### `jest.getRealSystemTime()`

When mocking time, `Date.now()` will also be mocked. If you for some reason need access to the real current time, you can invoke this function.

:::info

This function is not available when using legacy fake timers implementation.

:::

## Misc

### `jest.getSeed()`

Every time Jest runs a seed value is randomly generated which you could use in a pseudorandom number generator or anywhere else.

:::tip

Use the [`--showSeed`](CLI.md#--showseed) flag to print the seed in the test report summary. To manually set the value of the seed use [`--seed=<num>`](CLI.md#--seednum) CLI argument.

:::

### `jest.isEnvironmentTornDown()`

Returns `true` if test environment has been torn down.

### `jest.retryTimes(numRetries, options?)`

Runs failed tests n-times until they pass or until the max number of retries is exhausted.

```js
jest.retryTimes(3);

test("will fail", () => {
  expect(true).toBe(false);
});
```

If `logErrorsBeforeRetry` option is enabled, error(s) that caused the test to fail will be logged to the console.

```js
jest.retryTimes(3, { logErrorsBeforeRetry: true });

test("will fail", () => {
  expect(true).toBe(false);
});
```

`waitBeforeRetry` is the number of milliseconds to wait before retrying.

```js
jest.retryTimes(3, { waitBeforeRetry: 1000 });

test("will fail", () => {
  expect(true).toBe(false);
});
```

`retryImmediately` option is used to retry the failed test immediately after the failure. If this option is not specified, the tests are retried after Jest is finished running all other tests in the file.

```js
jest.retryTimes(3, { retryImmediately: true });

test("will fail", () => {
  expect(true).toBe(false);
});
```

Returns the `jest` object for chaining.

:::caution

`jest.retryTimes()` must be declared at the top level of a test file or in a `describe` block.

:::

:::info

This function is only available with the default [jest-circus](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/jest-circus) runner.

:::

### `jest.setTimeout(timeout)`

Set the default timeout interval (in milliseconds) for all tests and before/after hooks in the test file. This only affects the test file from which this function is called. The default timeout interval is 5 seconds if this method is not called.

Example:

```js
jest.setTimeout(1000); // 1 second
```

:::tip

To set timeout intervals on different tests in the same file, use the [`timeout` option on each individual test](GlobalAPI.md#testname-fn-timeout).

If you want to set the timeout for all test files, use [`testTimeout`](Configuration.md#testtimeout-number) configuration option.

id: jest-platform
title: Jest Platform
---

You can cherry pick specific features of Jest and use them as standalone packages. Here's a list of the available packages:

## jest-changed-files

Tool for identifying modified files in a git/hg repository. Exports two functions:

- `getChangedFilesForRoots` returns a promise that resolves to an object with the changed files and repos.
- `findRepos` returns a promise that resolves to a set of repositories contained in the specified path.

### Example

```javascript
const { getChangedFilesForRoots } = require("jest-changed-files");

// print the set of modified files since last commit in the current repo
getChangedFilesForRoots(["./"], {
  lastCommit: true,
}).then((result) => console.log(result.changedFiles));
```

You can read more about `jest-changed-files` in the [readme file](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/packages/jest-changed-files/README.md).

## jest-diff

Tool for visualizing changes in data. Exports a function that compares two values of any type and returns a "pretty-printed" string illustrating the difference between the two arguments.

### Example

```javascript
const { diff } = require("jest-diff");

const a = { a: { b: { c: 5 } } };
const b = { a: { b: { c: 6 } } };

const result = diff(a, b);

// print diff
console.log(result);
```

## jest-docblock

Tool for extracting and parsing the comments at the top of a JavaScript file. Exports various functions to manipulate the data inside the comment block.

### Example

```javascript
const { parseWithComments } = require("jest-docblock");

const code = `
/**
 * This is a sample
 *
 * @flow
 */

 console.log('Hello World!');
`;

const parsed = parseWithComments(code);

// prints an object with two attributes: comments and pragmas.
console.log(parsed);
```

You can read more about `jest-docblock` in the [readme file](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/packages/jest-docblock/README.md).

## jest-get-type

Module that identifies the primitive type of any JavaScript value. Exports a function that returns a string with the type of the value passed as argument.

### Example

```javascript
const { getType } = require("jest-get-type");

const array = [1, 2, 3];
const nullValue = null;
const undefinedValue = undefined;

// prints 'array'
console.log(getType(array));
// prints 'null'
console.log(getType(nullValue));
// prints 'undefined'
console.log(getType(undefinedValue));
```

## jest-validate

Tool for validating configurations submitted by users. Exports a function that takes two arguments: the user's configuration and an object containing an example configuration and other options. The return value is an object with two attributes:

- `hasDeprecationWarnings`, a boolean indicating whether the submitted configuration has deprecation warnings,
- `isValid`, a boolean indicating whether the configuration is correct or not.

### Example

```javascript
const { validate } = require("jest-validate");

const configByUser = {
  transform: "<rootDir>/node_modules/my-custom-transform",
};

const result = validate(configByUser, {
  comment: "  Documentation: http://custom-docs.com",
  exampleConfig: { transform: "<rootDir>/node_modules/babel-jest" },
});

console.log(result);
```

You can read more about `jest-validate` in the [readme file](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/packages/jest-validate/README.md).

## jest-worker

Module used for parallelization of tasks. Exports a class `JestWorker` that takes the path of Node.js module and lets you call the module's exported methods as if they were class methods, returning a promise that resolves when the specified method finishes its execution in a forked process.

### Example

```javascript title="heavy-task.js"
module.exports = {
  myHeavyTask: (args) => {
    // long running CPU intensive task.
  },
};
```

```javascript title="main.js"
async function main() {
  const worker = new Worker(require.resolve("./heavy-task.js"));

  // run 2 tasks in parallel with different arguments
  const results = await Promise.all([
    worker.myHeavyTask({ foo: "bar" }),
    worker.myHeavyTask({ bar: "foo" }),
  ]);

  console.log(results);
}

main();
```

You can read more about `jest-worker` in the [readme file](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/packages/jest-worker/README.md).

## pretty-format

Exports a function that converts any JavaScript value into a human-readable string. Supports all built-in JavaScript types out of the box and allows extension for application-specific types via user-defined plugins.

### Example

```javascript
const { format: prettyFormat } = require("pretty-format");

const val = { object: {} };
val.circularReference = val;
val[Symbol("foo")] = "foo";
val.map = new Map([["prop", "value"]]);
val.array = [-0, Infinity, NaN];

console.log(prettyFormat(val));
```

## File: docs/ManualMocks.md

````markdown
---
id: manual-mocks
title: Manual Mocks
---

Manual mocks are used to stub out functionality with mock data. For example, instead of accessing a remote resource like a website or a database, you might want to create a manual mock that allows you to use fake data. This ensures your tests will be fast and not flaky.

## Mocking user modules

Manual mocks are defined by writing a module in a `__mocks__/` subdirectory immediately adjacent to the module. For example, to mock a module called `user` in the `models` directory, create a file called `user.js` and put it in the `models/__mocks__` directory.

:::caution

The `__mocks__` folder is case-sensitive, so naming the directory `__MOCKS__` will break on some systems.

:::

:::note

When we require that module in our tests (meaning we want to use the manual mock instead of the real implementation), explicitly calling `jest.mock('./moduleName')` is **required**.

:::

## Mocking Node modules

If the module you are mocking is a Node module (e.g.: `lodash`), the mock should be placed in the `__mocks__` directory adjacent to `node_modules` (unless you configured [`roots`](Configuration.md#roots-arraystring) to point to a folder other than the project root) and will be **automatically** mocked. There's no need to explicitly call `jest.mock('module_name')`.

Scoped modules (also known as [scoped packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scope)) can be mocked by creating a file in a directory structure that matches the name of the scoped module. For example, to mock a scoped module called `@scope/project-name`, create a file at `__mocks__/@scope/project-name.js`, creating the `@scope/` directory accordingly.

:::caution

If we want to mock Node's built-in modules (e.g.: `fs` or `path`), then explicitly calling e.g. `jest.mock('path')` is **required**, because built-in modules are not mocked by default.

:::

## Examples

```bash
.
├── config
├── __mocks__
│   └── fs.js
├── models
│   ├── __mocks__
│   │   └── user.js
│   └── user.js
├── node_modules
└── views
```

When a manual mock exists for a given module, Jest's module system will use that module when explicitly calling `jest.mock('moduleName')`. However, when `automock` is set to `true`, the manual mock implementation will be used instead of the automatically created mock, even if `jest.mock('moduleName')` is not called. To opt out of this behavior you will need to explicitly call `jest.unmock('moduleName')` in tests that should use the actual module implementation.

:::info

In order to mock properly, Jest needs `jest.mock('moduleName')` to be in the same scope as the `require/import` statement.

:::

Here's a contrived example where we have a module that provides a summary of all the files in a given directory. In this case, we use the core (built in) `fs` module.

```javascript title="FileSummarizer.js"
"use strict";

const fs = require("fs");

function summarizeFilesInDirectorySync(directory) {
  return fs.readdirSync(directory).map((fileName) => ({
    directory,
    fileName,
  }));
}

exports.summarizeFilesInDirectorySync = summarizeFilesInDirectorySync;
```

Since we'd like our tests to avoid actually hitting the disk (that's pretty slow and fragile), we create a manual mock for the `fs` module by extending an automatic mock. Our manual mock will implement custom versions of the `fs` APIs that we can build on for our tests:

```javascript title="__mocks__/fs.js"
"use strict";

const path = require("path");

const fs = jest.createMockFromModule("fs");

// This is a custom function that our tests can use during setup to specify
// what the files on the "mock" filesystem should look like when any of the
// `fs` APIs are used.
let mockFiles = Object.create(null);
function __setMockFiles(newMockFiles) {
  mockFiles = Object.create(null);
  for (const file in newMockFiles) {
    const dir = path.dirname(file);

    if (!mockFiles[dir]) {
      mockFiles[dir] = [];
    }
    mockFiles[dir].push(path.basename(file));
  }
}

// A custom version of `readdirSync` that reads from the special mocked out
// file list set via __setMockFiles
function readdirSync(directoryPath) {
  return mockFiles[directoryPath] || [];
}

fs.__setMockFiles = __setMockFiles;
fs.readdirSync = readdirSync;

module.exports = fs;
```

Now we write our test. In this case `jest.mock('fs')` must be called explicitly, because `fs` is Node’s built-in module:

```javascript title="__tests__/FileSummarizer-test.js"
"use strict";

jest.mock("fs");

describe("listFilesInDirectorySync", () => {
  const MOCK_FILE_INFO = {
    "/path/to/file1.js": 'console.log("file1 contents");',
    "/path/to/file2.txt": "file2 contents",
  };

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Set up some mocked out file info before each test
    require("fs").__setMockFiles(MOCK_FILE_INFO);
  });

  test("includes all files in the directory in the summary", () => {
    const FileSummarizer = require("../FileSummarizer");
    const fileSummary =
      FileSummarizer.summarizeFilesInDirectorySync("/path/to");

    expect(fileSummary.length).toBe(2);
  });
});
```

The example mock shown here uses [`jest.createMockFromModule`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestcreatemockfrommodulemodulename) to generate an automatic mock, and overrides its default behavior. This is the recommended approach, but is completely optional. If you do not want to use the automatic mock at all, you can export your own functions from the mock file. One downside to fully manual mocks is that they're manual – meaning you have to manually update them any time the module they are mocking changes. Because of this, it's best to use or extend the automatic mock when it works for your needs.

To ensure that a manual mock and its real implementation stay in sync, it might be useful to require the real module using [`jest.requireActual(moduleName)`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestrequireactualmodulename) in your manual mock and amending it with mock functions before exporting it.

The code for this example is available at [examples/manual-mocks](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/examples/manual-mocks).

## Using with ES module imports

If you're using [ES module imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) then you'll normally be inclined to put your `import` statements at the top of the test file. But often you need to instruct Jest to use a mock before modules use it. For this reason, Jest will automatically hoist `jest.mock` calls to the top of the module (before any imports). To learn more about this and see it in action, see [this repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/how-jest-mocking-works).

:::caution

`jest.mock` calls cannot be hoisted to the top of the module if you enabled ECMAScript modules support. The ESM module loader always evaluates the static imports before executing code. See [ECMAScriptModules](ECMAScriptModules.md) for details.

:::

## Mocking methods which are not implemented in JSDOM

If some code uses a method which JSDOM (the DOM implementation used by Jest) hasn't implemented yet, testing it is not easily possible. This is e.g. the case with `window.matchMedia()`. Jest returns `TypeError: window.matchMedia is not a function` and doesn't properly execute the test.

In this case, mocking `matchMedia` in the test file should solve the issue:

```js
Object.defineProperty(window, "matchMedia", {
  writable: true,
  value: jest.fn().mockImplementation((query) => ({
    matches: false,
    media: query,
    onchange: null,
    addListener: jest.fn(), // deprecated
    removeListener: jest.fn(), // deprecated
    addEventListener: jest.fn(),
    removeEventListener: jest.fn(),
    dispatchEvent: jest.fn(),
  })),
});
```

This works if `window.matchMedia()` is used in a function (or method) which is invoked in the test. If `window.matchMedia()` is executed directly in the tested file, Jest reports the same error. In this case, the solution is to move the manual mock into a separate file and include this one in the test **before** the tested file:

```js
import "./matchMedia.mock"; // Must be imported before the tested file
import { myMethod } from "./file-to-test";

describe("myMethod()", () => {
  // Test the method here...
});
```

title: Migrating to Jest
---

If you'd like to try out Jest with an existing codebase, there are a number of ways to convert to Jest:

- If you are using Jasmine, or a Jasmine like API (for example [Mocha](https://mochajs.org)), Jest should be mostly compatible, which makes it less complicated to migrate to.
- If you are using AVA, Expect.js (by Automattic), Jasmine, Mocha, proxyquire, Should.js or Tape you can automatically migrate with Jest Codemods (see below).
- If you like [chai](http://chaijs.com/), you can upgrade to Jest and continue using chai. However, we recommend trying out Jest's assertions and their failure messages. Jest Codemods can migrate from chai (see below).

## jest-codemods

If you are using [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava), [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai), [Expect.js (by Automattic)](https://github.com/Automattic/expect.js), [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine), [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha), [proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire), [Should.js](https://github.com/shouldjs/should.js), [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape), or [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) you can use the third-party [jest-codemods](https://github.com/skovhus/jest-codemods) to do most of the dirty migration work. It runs a code transformation on your codebase using [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift).

To transform your existing tests, navigate to the project containing the tests and run:

```bash
npx jest-codemods
```

title: Mock Functions
---

Mock functions are also known as "spies", because they let you spy on the behavior of a function that is called indirectly by some other code, rather than only testing the output. You can create a mock function with `jest.fn()`. If no implementation is given, the mock function will return `undefined` when invoked.

## Reference

### `mockFn.getMockName()`

Returns the mock name string set by calling [`.mockName()`](#mockfnmocknamename).

### `mockFn.mock.calls`

An array containing the call arguments of all calls that have been made to this mock function. Each item in the array is an array of arguments that were passed during the call.

For example: A mock function `f` that has been called twice, with the arguments `f('arg1', 'arg2')`, and then with the arguments `f('arg3', 'arg4')`, would have a `mock.calls` array that looks like this:

```js
[
  ["arg1", "arg2"],
  ["arg3", "arg4"],
];
```

### `mockFn.mock.results`

An array containing the results of all calls that have been made to this mock function. Each entry in this array is an object containing a `type` property, and a `value` property. `type` will be one of the following:

- `'return'` - Indicates that the call completed by returning normally.
- `'throw'` - Indicates that the call completed by throwing a value.
- `'incomplete'` - Indicates that the call has not yet completed. This occurs if you test the result from within the mock function itself, or from within a function that was called by the mock.

The `value` property contains the value that was thrown or returned. `value` is undefined when `type === 'incomplete'`.

For example: A mock function `f` that has been called three times, returning `'result1'`, throwing an error, and then returning `'result2'`, would have a `mock.results` array that looks like this:

```js
[
  {
    type: "return",
    value: "result1",
  },
  {
    type: "throw",
    value: {
      /* Error instance */
    },
  },
  {
    type: "return",
    value: "result2",
  },
];
```

### `mockFn.mock.instances`

An array that contains all the object instances that have been instantiated from this mock function using `new`.

For example: A mock function that has been instantiated twice would have the following `mock.instances` array:

```js
const mockFn = jest.fn();

const a = new mockFn();
const b = new mockFn();

mockFn.mock.instances[0] === a; // true
mockFn.mock.instances[1] === b; // true
```

### `mockFn.mock.contexts`

An array that contains the contexts for all calls of the mock function.

A context is the `this` value that a function receives when called. The context can be set using `Function.prototype.bind`, `Function.prototype.call` or `Function.prototype.apply`.

For example:

```js
const mockFn = jest.fn();

const boundMockFn = mockFn.bind(thisContext0);
boundMockFn("a", "b");
mockFn.call(thisContext1, "a", "b");
mockFn.apply(thisContext2, ["a", "b"]);

mockFn.mock.contexts[0] === thisContext0; // true
mockFn.mock.contexts[1] === thisContext1; // true
mockFn.mock.contexts[2] === thisContext2; // true
```

### `mockFn.mock.lastCall`

An array containing the call arguments of the last call that was made to this mock function. If the function was not called, it will return `undefined`.

For example: A mock function `f` that has been called twice, with the arguments `f('arg1', 'arg2')`, and then with the arguments `f('arg3', 'arg4')`, would have a `mock.lastCall` array that looks like this:

```js
["arg3", "arg4"];
```

### `mockFn.mockClear()`

Clears all information stored in the [`mockFn.mock.calls`](#mockfnmockcalls), [`mockFn.mock.instances`](#mockfnmockinstances), [`mockFn.mock.contexts`](#mockfnmockcontexts) and [`mockFn.mock.results`](#mockfnmockresults) arrays. Often this is useful when you want to clean up a mocks usage data between two assertions.

The [`clearMocks`](configuration#clearmocks-boolean) configuration option is available to clear mocks automatically before each tests.

:::caution

Beware that `mockFn.mockClear()` will replace `mockFn.mock`, not just reset the values of its properties! You should, therefore, avoid assigning `mockFn.mock` to other variables, temporary or not, to make sure you don't access stale data.

:::

### `mockFn.mockReset()`

Does everything that [`mockFn.mockClear()`](#mockfnmockclear) does, and also replaces the mock implementation with an empty function, returning `undefined`.

The [`resetMocks`](configuration#resetmocks-boolean) configuration option is available to reset mocks automatically before each test.

### `mockFn.mockRestore()`

Does everything that [`mockFn.mockReset()`](#mockfnmockreset) does, and also restores the original (non-mocked) implementation.

This is useful when you want to mock functions in certain test cases and restore the original implementation in others.

The [`restoreMocks`](configuration#restoremocks-boolean) configuration option is available to restore mocks automatically before each test.

:::info

`mockFn.mockRestore()` only works when the mock was created with `jest.spyOn()`. Thus you have to take care of restoration yourself when manually assigning `jest.fn()`.

:::

### `mockFn.mockImplementation(fn)`

Accepts a function that should be used as the implementation of the mock. The mock itself will still record all calls that go into and instances that come from itself – the only difference is that the implementation will also be executed when the mock is called.

:::tip

`jest.fn(implementation)` is a shorthand for `jest.fn().mockImplementation(implementation)`.

:::

```js tab
const mockFn = jest.fn((scalar) => 42 + scalar);

mockFn(0); // 42
mockFn(1); // 43

mockFn.mockImplementation((scalar) => 36 + scalar);

mockFn(2); // 38
mockFn(3); // 39
```

```ts tab
import { jest } from "@jest/globals";

const mockFn = jest.fn((scalar: number) => 42 + scalar);

mockFn(0); // 42
mockFn(1); // 43

mockFn.mockImplementation((scalar) => 36 + scalar);

mockFn(2); // 38
mockFn(3); // 39
```

`.mockImplementation()` can also be used to mock class constructors:

```js tab={"span":2} title="SomeClass.js"
module.exports = class SomeClass {
  method(a, b) {}
};
```

```js title="SomeClass.test.js"
const SomeClass = require("./SomeClass");

jest.mock("./SomeClass"); // this happens automatically with automocking

const mockMethod = jest.fn();
SomeClass.mockImplementation(() => {
  return {
    method: mockMethod,
  };
});

const some = new SomeClass();
some.method("a", "b");

console.log("Calls to method:", mockMethod.mock.calls);
```

```ts tab={"span":2} title="SomeClass.ts"
export class SomeClass {
  method(a: string, b: string): void {}
}
```

```ts title="SomeClass.test.ts"
import { jest } from "@jest/globals";
import { SomeClass } from "./SomeClass";

jest.mock("./SomeClass"); // this happens automatically with automocking

const mockMethod = jest.fn<(a: string, b: string) => void>();
jest.mocked(SomeClass).mockImplementation(() => {
  return {
    method: mockMethod,
  };
});

const some = new SomeClass();
some.method("a", "b");

console.log("Calls to method:", mockMethod.mock.calls);
```

### `mockFn.mockImplementationOnce(fn)`

Accepts a function that will be used as an implementation of the mock for one call to the mocked function. Can be chained so that multiple function calls produce different results.

```js tab
const mockFn = jest
  .fn()
  .mockImplementationOnce((cb) => cb(null, true))
  .mockImplementationOnce((cb) => cb(null, false));

mockFn((err, val) => console.log(val)); // true
mockFn((err, val) => console.log(val)); // false
```

```ts tab
import { jest } from "@jest/globals";

const mockFn = jest
  .fn<(cb: (a: null, b: boolean) => void) => void>()
  .mockImplementationOnce((cb) => cb(null, true))
  .mockImplementationOnce((cb) => cb(null, false));

mockFn((err, val) => console.log(val)); // true
mockFn((err, val) => console.log(val)); // false
```

When the mocked function runs out of implementations defined with `.mockImplementationOnce()`, it will execute the default implementation set with `jest.fn(() => defaultValue)` or `.mockImplementation(() => defaultValue)` if they were called:

```js
const mockFn = jest
  .fn(() => "default")
  .mockImplementationOnce(() => "first call")
  .mockImplementationOnce(() => "second call");

mockFn(); // 'first call'
mockFn(); // 'second call'
mockFn(); // 'default'
mockFn(); // 'default'
```

### `mockFn.mockName(name)`

Accepts a string to use in test result output in place of `'jest.fn()'` to indicate which mock function is being referenced.

For example:

```js
const mockFn = jest.fn().mockName("mockedFunction");

// mockFn();
expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

Will result in this error:

```bash
expect(mockedFunction).toHaveBeenCalled()

Expected number of calls: >= 1
Received number of calls:    0
```

### `mockFn.mockReturnThis()`

Shorthand for:

```js
jest.fn(function () {
  return this;
});
```

### `mockFn.mockReturnValue(value)`

Shorthand for:

```js
jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => value);
```

Accepts a value that will be returned whenever the mock function is called.

```js tab
const mock = jest.fn();

mock.mockReturnValue(42);
mock(); // 42

mock.mockReturnValue(43);
mock(); // 43
```

```ts tab
import { jest } from "@jest/globals";

const mock = jest.fn<() => number>();

mock.mockReturnValue(42);
mock(); // 42

mock.mockReturnValue(43);
mock(); // 43
```

### `mockFn.mockReturnValueOnce(value)`

Shorthand for:

```js
jest.fn().mockImplementationOnce(() => value);
```

Accepts a value that will be returned for one call to the mock function. Can be chained so that successive calls to the mock function return different values. When there are no more `mockReturnValueOnce` values to use, calls will return a value specified by `mockReturnValue`.

```js tab
const mockFn = jest
  .fn()
  .mockReturnValue("default")
  .mockReturnValueOnce("first call")
  .mockReturnValueOnce("second call");

mockFn(); // 'first call'
mockFn(); // 'second call'
mockFn(); // 'default'
mockFn(); // 'default'
```

```ts tab
import { jest } from "@jest/globals";

const mockFn = jest
  .fn<() => string>()
  .mockReturnValue("default")
  .mockReturnValueOnce("first call")
  .mockReturnValueOnce("second call");

mockFn(); // 'first call'
mockFn(); // 'second call'
mockFn(); // 'default'
mockFn(); // 'default'
```

### `mockFn.mockResolvedValue(value)`

Shorthand for:

```js
jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => Promise.resolve(value));
```

Useful to mock async functions in async tests:

```js tab
test("async test", async () => {
  const asyncMock = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(43);

  await asyncMock(); // 43
});
```

```ts tab
import { jest, test } from "@jest/globals";

test("async test", async () => {
  const asyncMock = jest.fn<() => Promise<number>>().mockResolvedValue(43);

  await asyncMock(); // 43
});
```

### `mockFn.mockResolvedValueOnce(value)`

Shorthand for:

```js
jest.fn().mockImplementationOnce(() => Promise.resolve(value));
```

Useful to resolve different values over multiple async calls:

```js tab
test("async test", async () => {
  const asyncMock = jest
    .fn()
    .mockResolvedValue("default")
    .mockResolvedValueOnce("first call")
    .mockResolvedValueOnce("second call");

  await asyncMock(); // 'first call'
  await asyncMock(); // 'second call'
  await asyncMock(); // 'default'
  await asyncMock(); // 'default'
});
```

```ts tab
import { jest, test } from "@jest/globals";

test("async test", async () => {
  const asyncMock = jest
    .fn<() => Promise<string>>()
    .mockResolvedValue("default")
    .mockResolvedValueOnce("first call")
    .mockResolvedValueOnce("second call");

  await asyncMock(); // 'first call'
  await asyncMock(); // 'second call'
  await asyncMock(); // 'default'
  await asyncMock(); // 'default'
});
```

### `mockFn.mockRejectedValue(value)`

Shorthand for:

```js
jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => Promise.reject(value));
```

Useful to create async mock functions that will always reject:

```js tab
test("async test", async () => {
  const asyncMock = jest
    .fn()
    .mockRejectedValue(new Error("Async error message"));

  await asyncMock(); // throws 'Async error message'
});
```

```ts tab
import { jest, test } from "@jest/globals";

test("async test", async () => {
  const asyncMock = jest
    .fn<() => Promise<never>>()
    .mockRejectedValue(new Error("Async error message"));

  await asyncMock(); // throws 'Async error message'
});
```

### `mockFn.mockRejectedValueOnce(value)`

Shorthand for:

```js
jest.fn().mockImplementationOnce(() => Promise.reject(value));
```

Useful together with `.mockResolvedValueOnce()` or to reject with different exceptions over multiple async calls:

```js tab
test("async test", async () => {
  const asyncMock = jest
    .fn()
    .mockResolvedValueOnce("first call")
    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error("Async error message"));

  await asyncMock(); // 'first call'
  await asyncMock(); // throws 'Async error message'
});
```

```ts tab
import { jest, test } from "@jest/globals";

test("async test", async () => {
  const asyncMock = jest
    .fn<() => Promise<string>>()
    .mockResolvedValueOnce("first call")
    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error("Async error message"));

  await asyncMock(); // 'first call'
  await asyncMock(); // throws 'Async error message'
});
```

### `mockFn.withImplementation(fn, callback)`

Accepts a function which should be temporarily used as the implementation of the mock while the callback is being executed.

```js
test("test", () => {
  const mock = jest.fn(() => "outside callback");

  mock.withImplementation(
    () => "inside callback",
    () => {
      mock(); // 'inside callback'
    }
  );

  mock(); // 'outside callback'
});
```

`mockFn.withImplementation` can be used regardless of whether or not the callback is asynchronous (returns a `thenable`). If the callback is asynchronous a promise will be returned. Awaiting the promise will await the callback and reset the implementation.

```js
test("async test", async () => {
  const mock = jest.fn(() => "outside callback");

  // We await this call since the callback is async
  await mock.withImplementation(
    () => "inside callback",
    async () => {
      mock(); // 'inside callback'
    }
  );

  mock(); // 'outside callback'
});
```

## Replaced Properties

### `replacedProperty.replaceValue(value)`

Changes the value of already replaced property. This is useful when you want to replace property and then adjust the value in specific tests. As an alternative, you can call [`jest.replaceProperty()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestreplacepropertyobject-propertykey-value) multiple times on same property.

### `replacedProperty.restore()`

Restores object's property to the original value.

Beware that `replacedProperty.restore()` only works when the property value was replaced with [`jest.replaceProperty()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestreplacepropertyobject-propertykey-value).

The [`restoreMocks`](configuration#restoremocks-boolean) configuration option is available to restore replaced properties automatically before each test.

## TypeScript Usage

<TypeScriptExamplesNote />

### `jest.fn(implementation?)`

Correct mock typings will be inferred if implementation is passed to [`jest.fn()`](JestObjectAPI.md#jestfnimplementation). There are many use cases where the implementation is omitted. To ensure type safety you may pass a generic type argument (also see the examples above for more reference):

```ts
import { expect, jest, test } from "@jest/globals";
import type add from "./add";
import calculate from "./calc";

test("calculate calls add", () => {
  // Create a new mock that can be used in place of `add`.
  const mockAdd = jest.fn<typeof add>();

  // `.mockImplementation()` now can infer that `a` and `b` are `number`
  // and that the returned value is a `number`.
  mockAdd.mockImplementation((a, b) => {
    // Yes, this mock is still adding two numbers but imagine this
    // was a complex function we are mocking.
    return a + b;
  });

  // `mockAdd` is properly typed and therefore accepted by anything
  // requiring `add`.
  calculate(mockAdd, 1, 2);

  expect(mockAdd).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  expect(mockAdd).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1, 2);
});
```

### `jest.Mock<T>`

Constructs the type of a mock function, e.g. the return type of `jest.fn()`. It can be useful if you have to defined a recursive mock function:

```ts
import { jest } from "@jest/globals";

const sumRecursively: jest.Mock<(value: number) => number> = jest.fn(
  (value) => {
    if (value === 0) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      return value + fn(value - 1);
    }
  }
);
```

### `jest.Mocked<Source>`

The `jest.Mocked<Source>` utility type returns the `Source` type wrapped with type definitions of Jest mock function.

```ts
import { expect, jest, test } from "@jest/globals";
import type { fetch } from "node-fetch";

jest.mock("node-fetch");

let mockedFetch: jest.Mocked<typeof fetch>;

afterEach(() => {
  mockedFetch.mockClear();
});

test("makes correct call", () => {
  mockedFetch = getMockedFetch();
  // ...
});

test("returns correct data", () => {
  mockedFetch = getMockedFetch();
  // ...
});
```

Types of classes, functions or objects can be passed as type argument to `jest.Mocked<Source>`. If you prefer to constrain the input type, use: `jest.MockedClass<Source>`, `jest.MockedFunction<Source>` or `jest.MockedObject<Source>`.

### `jest.Replaced<Source>`

The `jest.Replaced<Source>` utility type returns the `Source` type wrapped with type definitions of Jest [replaced property](#replaced-properties).

```ts title="src/utils.ts"
export function isLocalhost(): boolean {
  return process.env["HOSTNAME"] === "localhost";
}
```

```ts title="src/__tests__/utils.test.ts"
import { afterEach, expect, it, jest } from "@jest/globals";
import { isLocalhost } from "../utils";

let replacedEnv: jest.Replaced<typeof process.env> | undefined = undefined;

afterEach(() => {
  replacedEnv?.restore();
});

it("isLocalhost should detect localhost environment", () => {
  replacedEnv = jest.replaceProperty(process, "env", { HOSTNAME: "localhost" });

  expect(isLocalhost()).toBe(true);
});

it("isLocalhost should detect non-localhost environment", () => {
  replacedEnv = jest.replaceProperty(process, "env", {
    HOSTNAME: "example.com",
  });

  expect(isLocalhost()).toBe(false);
});
```

### `jest.mocked(source, options?)`

The `mocked()` helper method wraps types of the `source` object and its deep nested members with type definitions of Jest mock function. You can pass `{shallow: true}` as the `options` argument to disable the deeply mocked behavior.

Returns the `source` object.

```ts title="song.ts"
export const song = {
  one: {
    more: {
      time: (t: number) => {
        return t;
      },
    },
  },
};
```

```ts title="song.test.ts"
import { expect, jest, test } from "@jest/globals";
import { song } from "./song";

jest.mock("./song");
jest.spyOn(console, "log");

const mockedSong = jest.mocked(song);
// or through `jest.Mocked<Source>`
// const mockedSong = song as jest.Mocked<typeof song>;

test("deep method is typed correctly", () => {
  mockedSong.one.more.time.mockReturnValue(12);

  expect(mockedSong.one.more.time(10)).toBe(12);
  expect(mockedSong.one.more.time.mock.calls).toHaveLength(1);
});

test("direct usage", () => {
  jest.mocked(console.log).mockImplementation(() => {
    return;
  });

  console.log("one more time");

  expect(jest.mocked(console.log).mock.calls).toHaveLength(1);
});
```

### `jest.Spied<Source>`

Constructs the type of a spied class or function (i.e. the return type of `jest.spyOn()`).

```ts title="__utils__/setDateNow.ts"
import { jest } from "@jest/globals";

export function setDateNow(now: number): jest.Spied<typeof Date.now> {
  return jest.spyOn(Date, "now").mockReturnValue(now);
}
```

```ts
import { afterEach, expect, type jest, test } from "@jest/globals";
import { setDateNow } from "./__utils__/setDateNow";

let spiedDateNow: jest.Spied<typeof Date.now> | undefined = undefined;

afterEach(() => {
  spiedDateNow?.mockReset();
});

test("renders correctly with a given date", () => {
  spiedDateNow = setDateNow(1_482_363_367_071);
  // ...

  expect(spiedDateNow).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

Types of a class or function can be passed as type argument to `jest.Spied<Source>`. If you prefer to constrain the input type, use: `jest.SpiedClass<Source>` or `jest.SpiedFunction<Source>`.

Use `jest.SpiedGetter<Source>` or `jest.SpiedSetter<Source>` to create the type of a spied getter or setter respectively.

title: Mock Functions
---

Mock functions allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with `new`, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.

There are two ways to mock functions: Either by creating a mock function to use in test code, or writing a [`manual mock`](ManualMocks.md) to override a module dependency.

## Using a mock function

Let's imagine we're testing an implementation of a function `forEach`, which invokes a callback for each item in a supplied array.

```js title="forEach.js"
export function forEach(items, callback) {
  for (const item of items) {
    callback(item);
  }
}
```

To test this function, we can use a mock function, and inspect the mock's state to ensure the callback is invoked as expected.

```js title="forEach.test.js"
const forEach = require("./forEach");

const mockCallback = jest.fn((x) => 42 + x);

test("forEach mock function", () => {
  forEach([0, 1], mockCallback);

  // The mock function was called twice
  expect(mockCallback.mock.calls).toHaveLength(2);

  // The first argument of the first call to the function was 0
  expect(mockCallback.mock.calls[0][0]).toBe(0);

  // The first argument of the second call to the function was 1
  expect(mockCallback.mock.calls[1][0]).toBe(1);

  // The return value of the first call to the function was 42
  expect(mockCallback.mock.results[0].value).toBe(42);
});
```

## `.mock` property

All mock functions have this special `.mock` property, which is where data about how the function has been called and what the function returned is kept. The `.mock` property also tracks the value of `this` for each call, so it is possible to inspect this as well:

```javascript
const myMock1 = jest.fn();
const a = new myMock1();
console.log(myMock1.mock.instances);
// > [ <a> ]

const myMock2 = jest.fn();
const b = {};
const bound = myMock2.bind(b);
bound();
console.log(myMock2.mock.contexts);
// > [ <b> ]
```

These mock members are very useful in tests to assert how these functions get called, instantiated, or what they returned:

```javascript
// The function was called exactly once
expect(someMockFunction.mock.calls).toHaveLength(1);

// The first arg of the first call to the function was 'first arg'
expect(someMockFunction.mock.calls[0][0]).toBe("first arg");

// The second arg of the first call to the function was 'second arg'
expect(someMockFunction.mock.calls[0][1]).toBe("second arg");

// The return value of the first call to the function was 'return value'
expect(someMockFunction.mock.results[0].value).toBe("return value");

// The function was called with a certain `this` context: the `element` object.
expect(someMockFunction.mock.contexts[0]).toBe(element);

// This function was instantiated exactly twice
expect(someMockFunction.mock.instances.length).toBe(2);

// The object returned by the first instantiation of this function
// had a `name` property whose value was set to 'test'
expect(someMockFunction.mock.instances[0].name).toBe("test");

// The first argument of the last call to the function was 'test'
expect(someMockFunction.mock.lastCall[0]).toBe("test");
```

## Mock Return Values

Mock functions can also be used to inject test values into your code during a test:

```javascript
const myMock = jest.fn();
console.log(myMock());
// > undefined

myMock.mockReturnValueOnce(10).mockReturnValueOnce("x").mockReturnValue(true);

console.log(myMock(), myMock(), myMock(), myMock());
// > 10, 'x', true, true
```

Mock functions are also very effective in code that uses a functional continuation-passing style. Code written in this style helps avoid the need for complicated stubs that recreate the behavior of the real component they're standing in for, in favor of injecting values directly into the test right before they're used.

```javascript
const filterTestFn = jest.fn();

// Make the mock return `true` for the first call,
// and `false` for the second call
filterTestFn.mockReturnValueOnce(true).mockReturnValueOnce(false);

const result = [11, 12].filter((num) => filterTestFn(num));

console.log(result);
// > [11]
console.log(filterTestFn.mock.calls[0][0]); // 11
console.log(filterTestFn.mock.calls[1][0]); // 12
```

Most real-world examples actually involve getting ahold of a mock function on a dependent component and configuring that, but the technique is the same. In these cases, try to avoid the temptation to implement logic inside of any function that's not directly being tested.

## Mocking Modules

Suppose we have a class that fetches users from our API. The class uses [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to call the API then returns the `data` attribute which contains all the users:

```js title="users.js"
import axios from "axios";

class Users {
  static all() {
    return axios.get("/users.json").then((resp) => resp.data);
  }
}

export default Users;
```

Now, in order to test this method without actually hitting the API (and thus creating slow and fragile tests), we can use the `jest.mock(...)` function to automatically mock the axios module.

Once we mock the module we can provide a `mockResolvedValue` for `.get` that returns the data we want our test to assert against. In effect, we are saying that we want `axios.get('/users.json')` to return a fake response.

```js title="users.test.js"
import axios from "axios";
import Users from "./users";

jest.mock("axios");

test("should fetch users", () => {
  const users = [{ name: "Bob" }];
  const resp = { data: users };
  axios.get.mockResolvedValue(resp);

  // or you could use the following depending on your use case:
  // axios.get.mockImplementation(() => Promise.resolve(resp))

  return Users.all().then((data) => expect(data).toEqual(users));
});
```

## Mocking Partials

Subsets of a module can be mocked and the rest of the module can keep their actual implementation:

```js title="foo-bar-baz.js"
export const foo = "foo";
export const bar = () => "bar";
export default () => "baz";
```

```js
//test.js
import defaultExport, { bar, foo } from "../foo-bar-baz";

jest.mock("../foo-bar-baz", () => {
  const originalModule = jest.requireActual("../foo-bar-baz");

  //Mock the default export and named export 'foo'
  return {
    __esModule: true,
    ...originalModule,
    default: jest.fn(() => "mocked baz"),
    foo: "mocked foo",
  };
});

test("should do a partial mock", () => {
  const defaultExportResult = defaultExport();
  expect(defaultExportResult).toBe("mocked baz");
  expect(defaultExport).toHaveBeenCalled();

  expect(foo).toBe("mocked foo");
  expect(bar()).toBe("bar");
});
```

## Mock Implementations

Still, there are cases where it's useful to go beyond the ability to specify return values and full-on replace the implementation of a mock function. This can be done with `jest.fn` or the `mockImplementationOnce` method on mock functions.

```javascript
const myMockFn = jest.fn((cb) => cb(null, true));

myMockFn((err, val) => console.log(val));
// > true
```

The `mockImplementation` method is useful when you need to define the default implementation of a mock function that is created from another module:

```js title="foo.js"
module.exports = function () {
  // some implementation;
};
```

```js title="test.js"
jest.mock("../foo"); // this happens automatically with automocking
const foo = require("../foo");

// foo is a mock function
foo.mockImplementation(() => 42);
foo();
// > 42
```

When you need to recreate a complex behavior of a mock function such that multiple function calls produce different results, use the `mockImplementationOnce` method:

```javascript
const myMockFn = jest
  .fn()
  .mockImplementationOnce((cb) => cb(null, true))
  .mockImplementationOnce((cb) => cb(null, false));

myMockFn((err, val) => console.log(val));
// > true

myMockFn((err, val) => console.log(val));
// > false
```

When the mocked function runs out of implementations defined with `mockImplementationOnce`, it will execute the default implementation set with `jest.fn` (if it is defined):

```javascript
const myMockFn = jest
  .fn(() => "default")
  .mockImplementationOnce(() => "first call")
  .mockImplementationOnce(() => "second call");

console.log(myMockFn(), myMockFn(), myMockFn(), myMockFn());
// > 'first call', 'second call', 'default', 'default'
```

For cases where we have methods that are typically chained (and thus always need to return `this`), we have a sugary API to simplify this in the form of a `.mockReturnThis()` function that also sits on all mocks:

```javascript
const myObj = {
  myMethod: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
};

// is the same as

const otherObj = {
  myMethod: jest.fn(function () {
    return this;
  }),
};
```

## Mock Names

You can optionally provide a name for your mock functions, which will be displayed instead of `'jest.fn()'` in the test error output. Use [`.mockName()`](MockFunctionAPI.md#mockfnmocknamename) if you want to be able to quickly identify the mock function reporting an error in your test output.

```javascript
const myMockFn = jest
  .fn()
  .mockReturnValue("default")
  .mockImplementation((scalar) => 42 + scalar)
  .mockName("add42");
```

## Custom Matchers

Finally, in order to make it less demanding to assert how mock functions have been called, we've added some custom matcher functions for you:

```javascript
// The mock function was called at least once
expect(mockFunc).toHaveBeenCalled();

// The mock function was called at least once with the specified args
expect(mockFunc).toHaveBeenCalledWith(arg1, arg2);

// The last call to the mock function was called with the specified args
expect(mockFunc).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith(arg1, arg2);

// All calls and the name of the mock is written as a snapshot
expect(mockFunc).toMatchSnapshot();
```

These matchers are sugar for common forms of inspecting the `.mock` property. You can always do this manually yourself if that's more to your taste or if you need to do something more specific:

```javascript
// The mock function was called at least once
expect(mockFunc.mock.calls.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);

// The mock function was called at least once with the specified args
expect(mockFunc.mock.calls).toContainEqual([arg1, arg2]);

// The last call to the mock function was called with the specified args
expect(mockFunc.mock.calls[mockFunc.mock.calls.length - 1]).toEqual([
  arg1,
  arg2,
]);

// The first arg of the last call to the mock function was `42`
// (note that there is no sugar helper for this specific of an assertion)
expect(mockFunc.mock.calls[mockFunc.mock.calls.length - 1][0]).toBe(42);

// A snapshot will check that a mock was invoked the same number of times,
// in the same order, with the same arguments. It will also assert on the name.
expect(mockFunc.mock.calls).toEqual([[arg1, arg2]]);
expect(mockFunc.getMockName()).toBe("a mock name");
```

With the [Global Setup/Teardown](Configuration.md#globalsetup-string) and [Async Test Environment](Configuration.md#testenvironment-string) APIs, Jest can work smoothly with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Use jest-mongodb Preset

[Jest MongoDB](https://github.com/shelfio/jest-mongodb) provides all required configuration to run your tests using MongoDB.

1.  First install `@shelf/jest-mongodb`

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @shelf/jest-mongodb
```

2.  Specify preset in your Jest configuration:

```json
{
  "preset": "@shelf/jest-mongodb"
}
```

3.  Write your test

```js
const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

describe("insert", () => {
  let connection;
  let db;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    connection = await MongoClient.connect(globalThis.__MONGO_URI__, {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });
    db = await connection.db(globalThis.__MONGO_DB_NAME__);
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await connection.close();
  });

  it("should insert a doc into collection", async () => {
    const users = db.collection("users");

    const mockUser = { _id: "some-user-id", name: "John" };
    await users.insertOne(mockUser);

    const insertedUser = await users.findOne({ _id: "some-user-id" });
    expect(insertedUser).toEqual(mockUser);
  });
});
```

There's no need to load any dependencies.

See [documentation](https://github.com/shelfio/jest-mongodb) for details (configuring MongoDB version, etc).

## File: docs/Puppeteer.md

id: puppeteer
title: Using with puppeteer
---

With the [Global Setup/Teardown](Configuration.md#globalsetup-string) and [Async Test Environment](Configuration.md#testenvironment-string) APIs, Jest can work smoothly with [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

:::note

Generating code coverage for test files using Puppeteer is currently not possible if your test uses `page.$eval`, `page.$$eval` or `page.evaluate` as the passed function is executed outside of Jest's scope. Check out [issue #7962](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/issues/7962#issuecomment-495272339) on GitHub for a workaround.

:::

## Use jest-puppeteer Preset

[Jest Puppeteer](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer) provides all required configuration to run your tests using Puppeteer.

1.  First, install `jest-puppeteer`

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev jest-puppeteer
```

2.  Specify preset in your [Jest configuration](Configuration.md):

```json
{
  "preset": "jest-puppeteer"
}
```

3.  Write your test

```js
describe("Google", () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await page.goto("https://google.com");
  });

  it('should be titled "Google"', async () => {
    await expect(page.title()).resolves.toMatch("Google");
  });
});
```

There's no need to load any dependencies. Puppeteer's `page` and `browser` classes will automatically be exposed

See [documentation](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer).

## Custom example without jest-puppeteer preset

You can also hook up puppeteer from scratch. The basic idea is to:

1.  launch & file the websocket endpoint of puppeteer with Global Setup
2.  connect to puppeteer from each Test Environment
3.  close puppeteer with Global Teardown

Here's an example of the GlobalSetup script

```js title="setup.js"
const { mkdir, writeFile } = require("fs").promises;
const os = require("os");
const path = require("path");
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

const DIR = path.join(os.tmpdir(), "jest_puppeteer_global_setup");

module.exports = async function () {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  // store the browser instance so we can teardown it later
  // this global is only available in the teardown but not in TestEnvironments
  globalThis.__BROWSER_GLOBAL__ = browser;

  // use the file system to expose the wsEndpoint for TestEnvironments
  await mkdir(DIR, { recursive: true });
  await writeFile(path.join(DIR, "wsEndpoint"), browser.wsEndpoint());
};
```

Then we need a custom Test Environment for puppeteer

```js title="puppeteer_environment.js"
const { readFile } = require("fs").promises;
const os = require("os");
const path = require("path");
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");
const NodeEnvironment = require("jest-environment-node").TestEnvironment;

const DIR = path.join(os.tmpdir(), "jest_puppeteer_global_setup");

class PuppeteerEnvironment extends NodeEnvironment {
  constructor(config) {
    super(config);
  }

  async setup() {
    await super.setup();
    // get the wsEndpoint
    const wsEndpoint = await readFile(path.join(DIR, "wsEndpoint"), "utf8");
    if (!wsEndpoint) {
      throw new Error("wsEndpoint not found");
    }

    // connect to puppeteer
    this.global.__BROWSER_GLOBAL__ = await puppeteer.connect({
      browserWSEndpoint: wsEndpoint,
    });
  }

  async teardown() {
    if (this.global.__BROWSER_GLOBAL__) {
      this.global.__BROWSER_GLOBAL__.disconnect();
    }
    await super.teardown();
  }

  getVmContext() {
    return super.getVmContext();
  }
}

module.exports = PuppeteerEnvironment;
```

Finally, we can close the puppeteer instance and clean-up the file

```js title="teardown.js"
const fs = require("fs").promises;
const os = require("os");
const path = require("path");

const DIR = path.join(os.tmpdir(), "jest_puppeteer_global_setup");
module.exports = async function () {
  // close the browser instance
  await globalThis.__BROWSER_GLOBAL__.close();

  // clean-up the wsEndpoint file
  await fs.rm(DIR, { recursive: true, force: true });
};
```

With all the things set up, we can now write our tests like this:

```js title="test.js"
const timeout = 5000;

describe(
  "/ (Home Page)",
  () => {
    let page;
    beforeAll(async () => {
      page = await globalThis.__BROWSER_GLOBAL__.newPage();
      await page.goto("https://google.com");
    }, timeout);

    it("should load without error", async () => {
      const text = await page.evaluate(() => document.body.textContent);
      expect(text).toContain("google");
    });
  },
  timeout
);
```

Finally, set `jest.config.js` to read from these files. (The `jest-puppeteer` preset does something like this under the hood.)

```js
module.exports = {
  globalSetup: "./setup.js",
  globalTeardown: "./teardown.js",
  testEnvironment: "./puppeteer_environment.js",
};
```

Here's the code of [full working example](https://github.com/xfumihiro/jest-puppeteer-example).
````

## File: docs/SetupAndTeardown.md

````markdown
---
id: setup-teardown
title: Setup and Teardown
---

Often while writing tests you have some setup work that needs to happen before tests run, and you have some finishing work that needs to happen after tests run. Jest provides helper functions to handle this.

## Repeating Setup

If you have some work you need to do repeatedly for many tests, you can use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks.

For example, let's say that several tests interact with a database of cities. You have a method `initializeCityDatabase()` that must be called before each of these tests, and a method `clearCityDatabase()` that must be called after each of these tests. You can do this with:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  initializeCityDatabase();
});

afterEach(() => {
  clearCityDatabase();
});

test("city database has Vienna", () => {
  expect(isCity("Vienna")).toBeTruthy();
});

test("city database has San Juan", () => {
  expect(isCity("San Juan")).toBeTruthy();
});
```

`beforeEach` and `afterEach` can handle asynchronous code in the same ways that [tests can handle asynchronous code](TestingAsyncCode.md) - they can either take a `done` parameter or return a promise. For example, if `initializeCityDatabase()` returned a promise that resolved when the database was initialized, we would want to return that promise:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  return initializeCityDatabase();
});
```

## One-Time Setup

In some cases, you only need to do setup once, at the beginning of a file. This can be especially bothersome when the setup is asynchronous, so you can't do it inline. Jest provides `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks to handle this situation.

For example, if both `initializeCityDatabase()` and `clearCityDatabase()` returned promises, and the city database could be reused between tests, we could change our test code to:

```js
beforeAll(() => {
  return initializeCityDatabase();
});

afterAll(() => {
  return clearCityDatabase();
});

test("city database has Vienna", () => {
  expect(isCity("Vienna")).toBeTruthy();
});

test("city database has San Juan", () => {
  expect(isCity("San Juan")).toBeTruthy();
});
```

## Scoping

The top level `before*` and `after*` hooks apply to every test in a file. The hooks declared inside a `describe` block apply only to the tests within that `describe` block.

For example, let's say we had not just a city database, but also a food database. We could do different setup for different tests:

```js
// Applies to all tests in this file
beforeEach(() => {
  return initializeCityDatabase();
});

test("city database has Vienna", () => {
  expect(isCity("Vienna")).toBeTruthy();
});

test("city database has San Juan", () => {
  expect(isCity("San Juan")).toBeTruthy();
});

describe("matching cities to foods", () => {
  // Applies only to tests in this describe block
  beforeEach(() => {
    return initializeFoodDatabase();
  });

  test("Vienna <3 veal", () => {
    expect(isValidCityFoodPair("Vienna", "Wiener Schnitzel")).toBe(true);
  });

  test("San Juan <3 plantains", () => {
    expect(isValidCityFoodPair("San Juan", "Mofongo")).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

Note that the top-level `beforeEach` is executed before the `beforeEach` inside the `describe` block. It may help to illustrate the order of execution of all hooks.

```js
beforeAll(() => console.log("1 - beforeAll"));
afterAll(() => console.log("1 - afterAll"));
beforeEach(() => console.log("1 - beforeEach"));
afterEach(() => console.log("1 - afterEach"));

test("", () => console.log("1 - test"));

describe("Scoped / Nested block", () => {
  beforeAll(() => console.log("2 - beforeAll"));
  afterAll(() => console.log("2 - afterAll"));
  beforeEach(() => console.log("2 - beforeEach"));
  afterEach(() => console.log("2 - afterEach"));

  test("", () => console.log("2 - test"));
});

// 1 - beforeAll
// 1 - beforeEach
// 1 - test
// 1 - afterEach
// 2 - beforeAll
// 1 - beforeEach
// 2 - beforeEach
// 2 - test
// 2 - afterEach
// 1 - afterEach
// 2 - afterAll
// 1 - afterAll
```

## Order of Execution

Jest executes all describe handlers in a test file _before_ it executes any of the actual tests. This is another reason to do setup and teardown inside `before*` and `after*` handlers rather than inside the `describe` blocks. Once the `describe` blocks are complete, by default Jest runs all the tests serially in the order they were encountered in the collection phase, waiting for each to finish and be tidied up before moving on.

Consider the following illustrative test file and output:

```js
describe("describe outer", () => {
  console.log("describe outer-a");

  describe("describe inner 1", () => {
    console.log("describe inner 1");

    test("test 1", () => console.log("test 1"));
  });

  console.log("describe outer-b");

  test("test 2", () => console.log("test 2"));

  describe("describe inner 2", () => {
    console.log("describe inner 2");

    test("test 3", () => console.log("test 3"));
  });

  console.log("describe outer-c");
});

// describe outer-a
// describe inner 1
// describe outer-b
// describe inner 2
// describe outer-c
// test 1
// test 2
// test 3
```

Just like the `describe` and `test` blocks Jest calls the `before*` and `after*` hooks in the order of declaration. Note that the `after*` hooks of the enclosing scope are called first. For example, here is how you can set up and tear down resources which depend on each other:

```js
beforeEach(() => console.log("connection setup"));
beforeEach(() => console.log("database setup"));

afterEach(() => console.log("database teardown"));
afterEach(() => console.log("connection teardown"));

test("test 1", () => console.log("test 1"));

describe("extra", () => {
  beforeEach(() => console.log("extra database setup"));
  afterEach(() => console.log("extra database teardown"));

  test("test 2", () => console.log("test 2"));
});

// connection setup
// database setup
// test 1
// database teardown
// connection teardown

// connection setup
// database setup
// extra database setup
// test 2
// extra database teardown
// database teardown
// connection teardown
```

:::note

If you are using `jasmine2` test runner, take into account that it calls the `after*` hooks in the reverse order of declaration. To have identical output, the above example should be altered like this:

```diff
  beforeEach(() => console.log('connection setup'));
+ afterEach(() => console.log('connection teardown'));

  beforeEach(() => console.log('database setup'));
+ afterEach(() => console.log('database teardown'));

- afterEach(() => console.log('database teardown'));
- afterEach(() => console.log('connection teardown'));

  // ...
```

:::

## General Advice

If a test is failing, one of the first things to check should be whether the test is failing when it's the only test that runs. To run only one test with Jest, temporarily change that `test` command to a `test.only`:

```js
test.only("this will be the only test that runs", () => {
  expect(true).toBe(false);
});

test("this test will not run", () => {
  expect("A").toBe("A");
});
```

If you have a test that often fails when it's run as part of a larger suite, but doesn't fail when you run it alone, it's a good bet that something from a different test is interfering with this one. You can often fix this by clearing some shared state with `beforeEach`. If you're not sure whether some shared state is being modified, you can also try a `beforeEach` that logs data.

## File: docs/SnapshotTesting.md

id: snapshot-testing
title: Snapshot Testing
---

Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly.

A typical snapshot test case renders a UI component, takes a snapshot, then compares it to a reference snapshot file stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two snapshots do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the reference snapshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component.

## Snapshot Testing with Jest

A similar approach can be taken when it comes to testing your React components. Instead of rendering the graphical UI, which would require building the entire app, you can use a test renderer to quickly generate a serializable value for your React tree. Consider this [example test](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/examples/snapshot/__tests__/link.test.js) for a [Link component](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/examples/snapshot/Link.js):

```tsx
import renderer from "react-test-renderer";
import Link from "../Link";

it("renders correctly", () => {
  const tree = renderer
    .create(<Link page="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</Link>)
    .toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

The first time this test is run, Jest creates a [snapshot file](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/examples/snapshot/__tests__/__snapshots__/link.test.js.snap) that looks like this:

```javascript
exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `
<a
  className="normal"
  href="http://www.facebook.com"
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`;
```

The snapshot artifact should be committed alongside code changes, and reviewed as part of your code review process. Jest uses [pretty-format](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/pretty-format) to make snapshots human-readable during code review. On subsequent test runs, Jest will compare the rendered output with the previous snapshot. If they match, the test will pass. If they don't match, either the test runner found a bug in your code (in the `<Link>` component in this case) that should be fixed, or the implementation has changed and the snapshot needs to be updated.

:::note

The snapshot is directly scoped to the data you render – in our example the `<Link>` component with `page` prop passed to it. This implies that even if any other file has missing props (say, `App.js`) in the `<Link>` component, it will still pass the test as the test doesn't know the usage of `<Link>` component and it's scoped only to the `Link.js`. Also, rendering the same component with different props in other snapshot tests will not affect the first one, as the tests don't know about each other.

More information on how snapshot testing works and why we built it can be found on the [release blog post](/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14). We recommend reading [this blog post](http://benmccormick.org/2016/09/19/testing-with-jest-snapshots-first-impressions/) to get a good sense of when you should use snapshot testing. We also recommend watching this [egghead video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-use-jest-s-snapshot-testing-feature?pl=testing-javascript-with-jest-a36c4074) on Snapshot Testing with Jest.

### Updating Snapshots

It's straightforward to spot when a snapshot test fails after a bug has been introduced. When that happens, go ahead and fix the issue and make sure your snapshot tests are passing again. Now, let's talk about the case when a snapshot test is failing due to an intentional implementation change.

One such situation can arise if we intentionally change the address the Link component in our example is pointing to.

```tsx
// Updated test case with a Link to a different address
it("renders correctly", () => {
  const tree = renderer
    .create(<Link page="http://www.instagram.com">Instagram</Link>)
    .toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

In that case, Jest will print this output:

![](/img/content/failedSnapshotTest.png)

Since we just updated our component to point to a different address, it's reasonable to expect changes in the snapshot for this component. Our snapshot test case is failing because the snapshot for our updated component no longer matches the snapshot artifact for this test case.

To resolve this, we will need to update our snapshot artifacts. You can run Jest with a flag that will tell it to re-generate snapshots:

```bash
jest --updateSnapshot
```

Go ahead and accept the changes by running the above command. You may also use the equivalent single-character `-u` flag to re-generate snapshots if you prefer. This will re-generate snapshot artifacts for all failing snapshot tests. If we had any additional failing snapshot tests due to an unintentional bug, we would need to fix the bug before re-generating snapshots to avoid recording snapshots of the buggy behavior.

If you'd like to limit which snapshot test cases get re-generated, you can pass an additional `--testNamePattern` flag to re-record snapshots only for those tests that match the pattern.

You can try out this functionality by cloning the [snapshot example](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/examples/snapshot), modifying the `Link` component, and running Jest.

### Interactive Snapshot Mode

Failed snapshots can also be updated interactively in watch mode:

![](/img/content/interactiveSnapshot.png)

Once you enter Interactive Snapshot Mode, Jest will step you through the failed snapshots one test at a time and give you the opportunity to review the failed output.

From here you can choose to update that snapshot or skip to the next:

![](/img/content/interactiveSnapshotUpdate.gif)

Once you're finished, Jest will give you a summary before returning back to watch mode:

![](/img/content/interactiveSnapshotDone.png)

### Inline Snapshots

Inline snapshots behave identically to external snapshots (`.snap` files), except the snapshot values are written automatically back into the source code. This means you can get the benefits of automatically generated snapshots without having to switch to an external file to make sure the correct value was written.

Example:

First, you write a test, calling `.toMatchInlineSnapshot()` with no arguments:

```tsx
it("renders correctly", () => {
  const tree = renderer
    .create(<Link page="https://example.com">Example Site</Link>)
    .toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchInlineSnapshot();
});
```

The next time you run Jest, `tree` will be evaluated, and a snapshot will be written as an argument to `toMatchInlineSnapshot`:

```tsx
it("renders correctly", () => {
  const tree = renderer
    .create(<Link page="https://example.com">Example Site</Link>)
    .toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    <a
      className="normal"
      href="https://example.com"
      onMouseEnter={[Function]}
      onMouseLeave={[Function]}
    >
      Example Site
    </a>
  `);
});
```

That's all there is to it! You can even update the snapshots with `--updateSnapshot` or using the `u` key in `--watch` mode.

By default, Jest handles the writing of snapshots into your source code. However, if you're using [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) in your project, Jest will detect this and delegate the work to prettier instead (including honoring your configuration).

### Property Matchers

Often there are fields in the object you want to snapshot which are generated (like IDs and Dates). If you try to snapshot these objects, they will force the snapshot to fail on every run:

```javascript
it("will fail every time", () => {
  const user = {
    createdAt: new Date(),
    id: Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
    name: "LeBron James",
  };

  expect(user).toMatchSnapshot();
});

// Snapshot
exports[`will fail every time 1`] = `
{
  "createdAt": 2018-05-19T23:36:09.816Z,
  "id": 3,
  "name": "LeBron James",
}
`;
```

For these cases, Jest allows providing an asymmetric matcher for any property. These matchers are checked before the snapshot is written or tested, and then saved to the snapshot file instead of the received value:

```javascript
it("will check the matchers and pass", () => {
  const user = {
    createdAt: new Date(),
    id: Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
    name: "LeBron James",
  };

  expect(user).toMatchSnapshot({
    createdAt: expect.any(Date),
    id: expect.any(Number),
  });
});

// Snapshot
exports[`will check the matchers and pass 1`] = `
{
  "createdAt": Any<Date>,
  "id": Any<Number>,
  "name": "LeBron James",
}
`;
```

Any given value that is not a matcher will be checked exactly and saved to the snapshot:

```javascript
it("will check the values and pass", () => {
  const user = {
    createdAt: new Date(),
    name: "Bond... James Bond",
  };

  expect(user).toMatchSnapshot({
    createdAt: expect.any(Date),
    name: "Bond... James Bond",
  });
});

// Snapshot
exports[`will check the values and pass 1`] = `
{
  "createdAt": Any<Date>,
  "name": 'Bond... James Bond',
}
`;
```

:::tip

If the case concerns a string not an object then you need to replace random part of that string on your own before testing the snapshot.  
You can use for that e.g. [`replace()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) and [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).

```javascript
const randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random() * 100);
const stringWithRandomData = `<div id="${randomNumber}">Lorem ipsum</div>`;
const stringWithConstantData = stringWithRandomData.replace(/id="\d+"/, 123);
expect(stringWithConstantData).toMatchSnapshot();
```

Other ways this can be done is using the [snapshot serializer](Configuration.md#snapshotserializers-arraystring) or [mocking](MockFunctions.md) the library responsible for generating the random part of the code you're snapshotting.

## Best Practices

Snapshots are a fantastic tool for identifying unexpected interface changes within your application – whether that interface is an API response, UI, logs, or error messages. As with any testing strategy, there are some best-practices you should be aware of, and guidelines you should follow, in order to use them effectively.

### 1. Treat snapshots as code

Commit snapshots and review them as part of your regular code review process. This means treating snapshots as you would any other type of test or code in your project.

Ensure that your snapshots are readable by keeping them focused, short, and by using tools that enforce these stylistic conventions.

As mentioned previously, Jest uses [`pretty-format`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/pretty-format) to make snapshots human-readable, but you may find it useful to introduce additional tools, like [`eslint-plugin-jest`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/eslint-plugin-jest) with its [`no-large-snapshots`](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest/blob/main/docs/rules/no-large-snapshots.md) option, or [`snapshot-diff`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/snapshot-diff) with its component snapshot comparison feature, to promote committing short, focused assertions.

The goal is to make it easy to review snapshots in pull requests, and fight against the habit of regenerating snapshots when test suites fail instead of examining the root causes of their failure.

### 2. Tests should be deterministic

Your tests should be deterministic. Running the same tests multiple times on a component that has not changed should produce the same results every time. You're responsible for making sure your generated snapshots do not include platform specific or other non-deterministic data.

For example, if you have a [Clock](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/examples/snapshot/Clock.js) component that uses `Date.now()`, the snapshot generated from this component will be different every time the test case is run. In this case we can [mock the Date.now() method](MockFunctions.md) to return a consistent value every time the test is run:

```js
Date.now = jest.fn(() => 1_482_363_367_071);
```

Now, every time the snapshot test case runs, `Date.now()` will return `1482363367071` consistently. This will result in the same snapshot being generated for this component regardless of when the test is run.

### 3. Use descriptive snapshot names

Always strive to use descriptive test and/or snapshot names for snapshots. The best names describe the expected snapshot content. This makes it easier for reviewers to verify the snapshots during review, and for anyone to know whether or not an outdated snapshot is the correct behavior before updating.

For example, compare:

```js
exports[`<UserName /> should handle some test case`] = `null`;

exports[`<UserName /> should handle some other test case`] = `
<div>
  Alan Turing
</div>
`;
```

To:

```js
exports[`<UserName /> should render null`] = `null`;

exports[`<UserName /> should render Alan Turing`] = `
<div>
  Alan Turing
</div>
`;
```

Since the latter describes exactly what's expected in the output, it's more clear to see when it's wrong:

```js
exports[`<UserName /> should render null`] = `
<div>
  Alan Turing
</div>
`;

exports[`<UserName /> should render Alan Turing`] = `null`;
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are snapshots written automatically on Continuous Integration (CI) systems?

No, as of Jest 20, snapshots in Jest are not automatically written when Jest is run in a CI system without explicitly passing `--updateSnapshot`. It is expected that all snapshots are part of the code that is run on CI and since new snapshots automatically pass, they should not pass a test run on a CI system. It is recommended to always commit all snapshots and to keep them in version control.

### Should snapshot files be committed?

Yes, all snapshot files should be committed alongside the modules they are covering and their tests. They should be considered part of a test, similar to the value of any other assertion in Jest. In fact, snapshots represent the state of the source modules at any given point in time. In this way, when the source modules are modified, Jest can tell what changed from the previous version. It can also provide a lot of additional context during code review in which reviewers can study your changes better.

### Does snapshot testing only work with React components?

[React](TutorialReact.md) and [React Native](TutorialReactNative.md) components are a good use case for snapshot testing. However, snapshots can capture any serializable value and should be used anytime the goal is testing whether the output is correct. The Jest repository contains many examples of testing the output of Jest itself, the output of Jest's assertion library as well as log messages from various parts of the Jest codebase. See an example of [snapshotting CLI output](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/e2e/__tests__/console.test.ts) in the Jest repo.

### What's the difference between snapshot testing and visual regression testing?

Snapshot testing and visual regression testing are two distinct ways of testing UIs, and they serve different purposes. Visual regression testing tools take screenshots of web pages and compare the resulting images pixel by pixel. With Snapshot testing values are serialized, stored within text files, and compared using a diff algorithm. There are different trade-offs to consider and we listed the reasons why snapshot testing was built in the [Jest blog](/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14#why-snapshot-testing).

### Does snapshot testing replace unit testing?

Snapshot testing is only one of more than 20 assertions that ship with Jest. The aim of snapshot testing is not to replace existing unit tests, but to provide additional value and make testing painless. In some scenarios, snapshot testing can potentially remove the need for unit testing for a particular set of functionalities (e.g. React components), but they can work together as well.

### What is the performance of snapshot testing regarding speed and size of the generated files?

Jest has been rewritten with performance in mind, and snapshot testing is not an exception. Since snapshots are stored within text files, this way of testing is fast and reliable. Jest generates a new file for each test file that invokes the `toMatchSnapshot` matcher. The size of the snapshots is pretty small: For reference, the size of all snapshot files in the Jest codebase itself is less than 300 KB.

### How do I resolve conflicts within snapshot files?

Snapshot files must always represent the current state of the modules they are covering. Therefore, if you are merging two branches and encounter a conflict in the snapshot files, you can either resolve the conflict manually or update the snapshot file by running Jest and inspecting the result.

### Is it possible to apply test-driven development principles with snapshot testing?

Although it is possible to write snapshot files manually, that is usually not approachable. Snapshots help to figure out whether the output of the modules covered by tests is changed, rather than giving guidance to design the code in the first place.

### Does code coverage work with snapshot testing?

Yes, as well as with any other test.

## File: docs/TestingAsyncCode.md

````markdown
---
id: asynchronous
title: Testing Asynchronous Code
---

It's common in JavaScript for code to run asynchronously. When you have code that runs asynchronously, Jest needs to know when the code it is testing has completed, before it can move on to another test. Jest has several ways to handle this.

## Promises

Return a promise from your test, and Jest will wait for that promise to resolve. If the promise is rejected, the test will fail.

For example, let's say that `fetchData` returns a promise that is supposed to resolve to the string `'peanut butter'`. We could test it with:

```js
test("the data is peanut butter", () => {
  return fetchData().then((data) => {
    expect(data).toBe("peanut butter");
  });
});
```

## Async/Await

Alternatively, you can use `async` and `await` in your tests. To write an async test, use the `async` keyword in front of the function passed to `test`. For example, the same `fetchData` scenario can be tested with:

```js
test("the data is peanut butter", async () => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  expect(data).toBe("peanut butter");
});

test("the fetch fails with an error", async () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  try {
    await fetchData();
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error).toMatch("error");
  }
});
```

You can combine `async` and `await` with `.resolves` or `.rejects`.

```js
test("the data is peanut butter", async () => {
  await expect(fetchData()).resolves.toBe("peanut butter");
});

test("the fetch fails with an error", async () => {
  await expect(fetchData()).rejects.toMatch("error");
});
```

In these cases, `async` and `await` are effectively syntactic sugar for the same logic as the promises example uses.

:::caution

Be sure to return (or `await`) the promise - if you omit the `return`/`await` statement, your test will complete before the promise returned from `fetchData` resolves or rejects.

:::

If you expect a promise to be rejected, use the `.catch` method. Make sure to add `expect.assertions` to verify that a certain number of assertions are called. Otherwise, a fulfilled promise would not fail the test.

```js
test("the fetch fails with an error", () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  return fetchData().catch((error) => expect(error).toMatch("error"));
});
```

## Callbacks

If you don't use promises, you can use callbacks. For example, let's say that `fetchData`, instead of returning a promise, expects a callback, i.e. fetches some data and calls `callback(null, data)` when it is complete. You want to test that this returned data is the string `'peanut butter'`.

By default, Jest tests complete once they reach the end of their execution. That means this test will _not_ work as intended:

```js
// Don't do this!
test("the data is peanut butter", () => {
  function callback(error, data) {
    if (error) {
      throw error;
    }
    expect(data).toBe("peanut butter");
  }

  fetchData(callback);
});
```

The problem is that the test will complete as soon as `fetchData` completes, before ever calling the callback.

There is an alternate form of `test` that fixes this. Instead of putting the test in a function with an empty argument, use a single argument called `done`. Jest will wait until the `done` callback is called before finishing the test.

```js
test("the data is peanut butter", (done) => {
  function callback(error, data) {
    if (error) {
      done(error);
      return;
    }
    try {
      expect(data).toBe("peanut butter");
      done();
    } catch (error) {
      done(error);
    }
  }

  fetchData(callback);
});
```

If `done()` is never called, the test will fail (with timeout error), which is what you want to happen.

If the `expect` statement fails, it throws an error and `done()` is not called. If we want to see in the test log why it failed, we have to wrap `expect` in a `try` block and pass the error in the `catch` block to `done`. Otherwise, we end up with an opaque timeout error that doesn't show what value was received by `expect(data)`.

:::caution

Jest will throw an error, if the same test function is passed a `done()` callback and returns a promise. This is done as a precaution to avoid memory leaks in your tests.

:::

## `.resolves` / `.rejects`

You can also use the `.resolves` matcher in your expect statement, and Jest will wait for that promise to resolve. If the promise is rejected, the test will automatically fail.

```js
test("the data is peanut butter", () => {
  return expect(fetchData()).resolves.toBe("peanut butter");
});
```

Be sure to return the assertion—if you omit this `return` statement, your test will complete before the promise returned from `fetchData` is resolved and then() has a chance to execute the callback.

If you expect a promise to be rejected, use the `.rejects` matcher. It works analogically to the `.resolves` matcher. If the promise is fulfilled, the test will automatically fail.

```js
test("the fetch fails with an error", () => {
  return expect(fetchData()).rejects.toMatch("error");
});
```

None of these forms is particularly superior to the others, and you can mix and match them across a codebase or even in a single file. It just depends on which style you feel makes your tests simpler.

````markdown

id: timer-mocks
title: Timer Mocks
---

The native timer functions (i.e., `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, `clearTimeout()`, `clearInterval()`) are less than ideal for a testing environment since they depend on real time to elapse. Jest can swap out timers with functions that allow you to control the passage of time. [Great Scott!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZoJ2Pt27BY)

:::info

Also see [Fake Timers API](JestObjectAPI.md#fake-timers) documentation.

:::

## Enable Fake Timers

In the following example we enable fake timers by calling `jest.useFakeTimers()`. This is replacing the original implementation of `setTimeout()` and other timer functions. Timers can be restored to their normal behavior with `jest.useRealTimers()`.

```javascript title="timerGame.js"
function timerGame(callback) {
  console.log("Ready....go!");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Time's up -- stop!");
    callback && callback();
  }, 1000);
}

module.exports = timerGame;
```

```javascript title="__tests__/timerGame-test.js"
jest.useFakeTimers();
jest.spyOn(global, "setTimeout");

test("waits 1 second before ending the game", () => {
  const timerGame = require("../timerGame");
  timerGame();

  expect(setTimeout).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  expect(setTimeout).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith(expect.any(Function), 1000);
});
```

## Run All Timers

Another test we might want to write for this module is one that asserts that the callback is called after 1 second. To do this, we're going to use Jest's timer control APIs to fast-forward time right in the middle of the test:

```javascript
jest.useFakeTimers();
test("calls the callback after 1 second", () => {
  const timerGame = require("../timerGame");
  const callback = jest.fn();

  timerGame(callback);

  // At this point in time, the callback should not have been called yet
  expect(callback).not.toHaveBeenCalled();

  // Fast-forward until all timers have been executed
  jest.runAllTimers();

  // Now our callback should have been called!
  expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

## Run Pending Timers

There are also scenarios where you might have a recursive timer – that is a timer that sets a new timer in its own callback. For these, running all the timers would be an endless loop, throwing the following error: "Aborting after running 100000 timers, assuming an infinite loop!"

If that is your case, using `jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()` will solve the problem:

```javascript title="infiniteTimerGame.js"
function infiniteTimerGame(callback) {
  console.log("Ready....go!");

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Time's up! 10 seconds before the next game starts...");
    callback && callback();

    // Schedule the next game in 10 seconds
    setTimeout(() => {
      infiniteTimerGame(callback);
    }, 10000);
  }, 1000);
}

module.exports = infiniteTimerGame;
```

```javascript title="__tests__/infiniteTimerGame-test.js"
jest.useFakeTimers();
jest.spyOn(global, "setTimeout");

describe("infiniteTimerGame", () => {
  test("schedules a 10-second timer after 1 second", () => {
    const infiniteTimerGame = require("../infiniteTimerGame");
    const callback = jest.fn();

    infiniteTimerGame(callback);

    // At this point in time, there should have been a single call to
    // setTimeout to schedule the end of the game in 1 second.
    expect(setTimeout).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    expect(setTimeout).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith(expect.any(Function), 1000);

    // Fast forward and exhaust only currently pending timers
    // (but not any new timers that get created during that process)
    jest.runOnlyPendingTimers();

    // At this point, our 1-second timer should have fired its callback
    expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();

    // And it should have created a new timer to start the game over in
    // 10 seconds
    expect(setTimeout).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
    expect(setTimeout).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith(expect.any(Function), 10000);
  });
});
```

:::note

For debugging or any other reason you can change the limit of timers that will be run before throwing an error:

```js
jest.useFakeTimers({ timerLimit: 100 });
```

:::

## Advance Timers by Time

Another possibility is use `jest.advanceTimersByTime(msToRun)`. When this API is called, all timers are advanced by `msToRun` milliseconds. All pending "macro-tasks" that have been queued via setTimeout() or setInterval(), and would be executed during this time frame, will be executed. Additionally, if those macro-tasks schedule new macro-tasks that would be executed within the same time frame, those will be executed until there are no more macro-tasks remaining in the queue that should be run within msToRun milliseconds.

```javascript title="timerGame.js"
function timerGame(callback) {
  console.log("Ready....go!");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Time's up -- stop!");
    callback && callback();
  }, 1000);
}

module.exports = timerGame;
```

```javascript title="__tests__/timerGame-test.js"
jest.useFakeTimers();
it("calls the callback after 1 second via advanceTimersByTime", () => {
  const timerGame = require("../timerGame");
  const callback = jest.fn();

  timerGame(callback);

  // At this point in time, the callback should not have been called yet
  expect(callback).not.toHaveBeenCalled();

  // Fast-forward until all timers have been executed
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);

  // Now our callback should have been called!
  expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

Lastly, it may occasionally be useful in some tests to be able to clear all of the pending timers. For this, we have `jest.clearAllTimers()`.

## Advance Timers to the next Frame

In applications, often you want to schedule work inside of an animation frame (with `requestAnimationFrame`). We expose a convenience method `jest.advanceTimersToNextFrame()` to advance all timers enough milliseconds to execute all actively scheduled animation frames.

For mock timing purposes, animation frames are executed every `16ms` (mapping to roughly `60` frames per second) after the clock starts. When you schedule a callback in an animation frame (with `requestAnimationFrame(callback)`), the `callback` will be called when the clock has advanced `16ms`. `jest.advanceTimersToNextFrame()` will advance the clock just enough to get to the next `16ms` increment. If the clock has already advanced `6ms` since a animation frame `callback` was scheduled, then the clock will be advanced by `10ms`.

```javascript
jest.useFakeTimers();
it("calls the animation frame callback after advanceTimersToNextFrame()", () => {
  const callback = jest.fn();

  requestAnimationFrame(callback);

  // At this point in time, the callback should not have been called yet
  expect(callback).not.toHaveBeenCalled();

  jest.advanceTimersToNextFrame();

  // Now our callback should have been called!
  expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

## Selective Faking

Sometimes your code may require to avoid overwriting the original implementation of one or another API. If that is the case, you can use `doNotFake` option. For example, here is how you could provide a custom mock function for `performance.mark()` in jsdom environment:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

const mockPerformanceMark = jest.fn();
window.performance.mark = mockPerformanceMark;

test("allows mocking `performance.mark()`", () => {
  jest.useFakeTimers({ doNotFake: ["performance"] });

  expect(window.performance.mark).toBe(mockPerformanceMark);
});
```

Uh oh, something went wrong? Use this guide to resolve issues with Jest.

## Tests are Failing and You Don't Know Why

Try using the [debugging support](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html) built into Node. Place a `debugger;` statement in any of your tests, and then, in your project's directory, run:

```bash
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand [any other arguments here]
or on Windows
node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --runInBand [any other arguments here]
```

This will run Jest in a Node process that an external debugger can connect to. Note that the process will pause until the debugger has connected to it.

To debug in Google Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser), open your browser and go to `chrome://inspect` and click on "Open Dedicated DevTools for Node", which will give you a list of available node instances you can connect to. Click on the address displayed in the terminal (usually something like `localhost:9229`) after running the above command, and you will be able to debug Jest using Chrome's DevTools.

The Chrome Developer Tools will be displayed, and a breakpoint will be set at the first line of the Jest CLI script (this is done to give you time to open the developer tools and to prevent Jest from executing before you have time to do so). Click the button that looks like a "play" button in the upper right hand side of the screen to continue execution. When Jest executes the test that contains the `debugger` statement, execution will pause and you can examine the current scope and call stack.

:::note

The `--runInBand` cli option makes sure Jest runs the test in the same process rather than spawning processes for individual tests. Normally Jest parallelizes test runs across processes but it is hard to debug many processes at the same time.

:::

## Debugging in VS Code

There are multiple ways to debug Jest tests with [Visual Studio Code's](https://code.visualstudio.com) built-in [debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging).

To attach the built-in debugger, run your tests as aforementioned:

```bash
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand [any other arguments here]
or on Windows
node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --runInBand [any other arguments here]
```

Then attach VS Code's debugger using the following `launch.json` config:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Attach",
      "port": 9229
    }
  ]
}
```

To automatically launch and attach to a process running your tests, use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Jest Tests",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeArgs": [
        "--inspect-brk",
        "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/jest",
        "--runInBand"
      ],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
    }
  ]
}
```

or the following for Windows:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Jest Tests",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeArgs": [
        "--inspect-brk",
        "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js",
        "--runInBand"
      ],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you are using Facebook's [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), you can debug your Jest tests with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug CRA Tests",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/react-scripts",
      "args": [
        "test",
        "--runInBand",
        "--no-cache",
        "--env=jsdom",
        "--watchAll=false"
      ],
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
    }
  ]
}
```

More information on Node debugging can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html).

## Debugging in WebStorm

[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) has built-in support for Jest. Read [Testing With Jest in WebStorm](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2018/10/testing-with-jest-in-webstorm/) to learn more.

## Caching Issues

The transform script was changed or Babel was updated and the changes aren't being recognized by Jest?

Retry with [`--no-cache`](CLI.md#--cache). Jest caches transformed module files to speed up test execution. If you are using your own custom transformer, consider adding a `getCacheKey` function to it: [getCacheKey in Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay/blob/58cf36c73769690f0bbf90562707eadb062b029d/scripts/jest/preprocessor.js#L56-L61).

## Unresolved Promises

If a promise doesn't resolve at all, this error might be thrown:

```bash
- Error: Timeout - Async callback was not invoked within timeout specified by jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL.
```

Most commonly this is being caused by conflicting Promise implementations. Consider replacing the global promise implementation with your own, for example `globalThis.Promise = jest.requireActual('promise');` and/or consolidate the used Promise libraries to a single one.

If your test is long running, you may want to consider to increase the timeout by calling `jest.setTimeout`

```js
jest.setTimeout(10_000); // 10 second timeout
```

## Watchman Issues

Try running Jest with [`--no-watchman`](CLI.md#--watchman) or set the `watchman` configuration option to `false`.

Also see [watchman troubleshooting](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/troubleshooting).

## Tests are Extremely Slow on Docker and/or Continuous Integration (CI) server.

While Jest is most of the time extremely fast on modern multi-core computers with fast SSDs, it may be slow on certain setups as our users [have](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/issues/1395) [discovered](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/issues/1524#issuecomment-260246008).

Based on the [findings](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/issues/1524#issuecomment-262366820), one way to mitigate this issue and improve the speed by up to 50% is to run tests sequentially.

In order to do this you can run tests in the same thread using [`--runInBand`](CLI.md#--runinband):

```bash npm2yarn
# Using Jest CLI
jest --runInBand

# Using your package manager's `test` script (e.g. with create-react-app)
npm test -- --runInBand
```

Another alternative to expediting test execution time on Continuous Integration Servers such as Travis-CI is to set the max worker pool to ~_4_. Specifically on Travis-CI, this can reduce test execution time in half. Note: The Travis CI _free_ plan available for open source projects only includes 2 CPU cores.

```bash npm2yarn
# Using Jest CLI
jest --maxWorkers=4

# Using your package manager's `test` script (e.g. with create-react-app)
npm test -- --maxWorkers=4
```

If you use GitHub Actions, you can use [`github-actions-cpu-cores`](https://github.com/SimenB/github-actions-cpu-cores) to detect number of CPUs, and pass that to Jest.

```yaml
- name: Get number of CPU cores
  id: cpu-cores
  uses: SimenB/github-actions-cpu-cores@v2
- name: run tests
  run: yarn jest --max-workers ${{ steps.cpu-cores.outputs.count }}
```

Another thing you can do is use the [`shard`](CLI.md#--shard) flag to parallelize the test run across multiple machines.

## `coveragePathIgnorePatterns` seems to not have any effect.

Make sure you are not using the `babel-plugin-istanbul` plugin. Jest wraps Istanbul, and therefore also tells Istanbul what files to instrument with coverage collection. When using `babel-plugin-istanbul`, every file that is processed by Babel will have coverage collection code, hence it is not being ignored by `coveragePathIgnorePatterns`.

## Defining Tests

Tests must be defined synchronously for Jest to be able to collect your tests.

As an example to show why this is the case, imagine we wrote a test like so:

```js
// Don't do this it will not work
setTimeout(() => {
  it("passes", () => expect(1).toBe(1));
}, 0);
```

When Jest runs your test to collect the `test`s it will not find any because we have set the definition to happen asynchronously on the next tick of the event loop. This means when you are using `test.each` you cannot set the table asynchronously within a `beforeEach` / `beforeAll`.

## File: docs/TutorialAsync.md

````markdown
---
id: tutorial-async
title: An Async Example
---

First, enable Babel support in Jest as documented in the [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md#using-babel) guide.

Let's implement a module that fetches user data from an API and returns the user name.

```js title="user.js"
import request from "./request";

export function getUserName(userID) {
  return request(`/users/${userID}`).then((user) => user.name);
}
```

In the above implementation, we expect the `request.js` module to return a promise. We chain a call to `then` to receive the user name.

Now imagine an implementation of `request.js` that goes to the network and fetches some user data:

```js title="request.js"
const http = require("http");

export default function request(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    // This is an example of an http request, for example to fetch
    // user data from an API.
    // This module is being mocked in __mocks__/request.js
    http.get({ path: url }, (response) => {
      let data = "";
      response.on("data", (_data) => (data += _data));
      response.on("end", () => resolve(data));
    });
  });
}
```

Because we don't want to go to the network in our test, we are going to create a manual mock for our `request.js` module in the `__mocks__` folder (the folder is case-sensitive, `__MOCKS__` will not work). It could look something like this:

```js title="__mocks__/request.js"
const users = {
  4: { name: "Mark" },
  5: { name: "Paul" },
};

export default function request(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const userID = parseInt(url.slice("/users/".length), 10);
    process.nextTick(() =>
      users[userID]
        ? resolve(users[userID])
        : reject({
            error: `User with ${userID} not found.`,
          })
    );
  });
}
```

Now let's write a test for our async functionality.

```js title="__tests__/user-test.js"
jest.mock("../request");

import * as user from "../user";

// The assertion for a promise must be returned.
it("works with promises", () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  return user.getUserName(4).then((data) => expect(data).toBe("Mark"));
});
```

We call `jest.mock('../request')` to tell Jest to use our manual mock. `it` expects the return value to be a Promise that is going to be resolved. You can chain as many Promises as you like and call `expect` at any time, as long as you return a Promise at the end.

## `.resolves`

There is a less verbose way using `resolves` to unwrap the value of a fulfilled promise together with any other matcher. If the promise is rejected, the assertion will fail.

```js
it("works with resolves", () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  return expect(user.getUserName(5)).resolves.toBe("Paul");
});
```

## `async`/`await`

Writing tests using the `async`/`await` syntax is also possible. Here is how you'd write the same examples from before:

```js
// async/await can be used.
it("works with async/await", async () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  const data = await user.getUserName(4);
  expect(data).toBe("Mark");
});

// async/await can also be used with `.resolves`.
it("works with async/await and resolves", async () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  await expect(user.getUserName(5)).resolves.toBe("Paul");
});
```

To enable async/await in your project, install [`@babel/preset-env`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) and enable the feature in your `babel.config.js` file.

## Error handling

Errors can be handled using the `.catch` method. Make sure to add `expect.assertions` to verify that a certain number of assertions are called. Otherwise a fulfilled promise would not fail the test:

```js
// Testing for async errors using Promise.catch.
it("tests error with promises", () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  return user.getUserName(2).catch((error) =>
    expect(error).toEqual({
      error: "User with 2 not found.",
    })
  );
});

// Or using async/await.
it("tests error with async/await", async () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  try {
    await user.getUserName(1);
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error).toEqual({
      error: "User with 1 not found.",
    });
  }
});
```

## `.rejects`

The`.rejects` helper works like the `.resolves` helper. If the promise is fulfilled, the test will automatically fail. `expect.assertions(number)` is not required but recommended to verify that a certain number of [assertions](expect#expectassertionsnumber) are called during a test. It is otherwise easy to forget to `return`/`await` the `.resolves` assertions.

```js
// Testing for async errors using `.rejects`.
it("tests error with rejects", () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  return expect(user.getUserName(3)).rejects.toEqual({
    error: "User with 3 not found.",
  });
});

// Or using async/await with `.rejects`.
it("tests error with async/await and rejects", async () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  await expect(user.getUserName(3)).rejects.toEqual({
    error: "User with 3 not found.",
  });
});
```

The code for this example is available at [examples/async](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/examples/async).

If you'd like to test timers, like `setTimeout`, take a look at the [Timer mocks](TimerMocks.md) documentation.

## File: docs/TutorialjQuery.md

````markdown
---
id: tutorial-jquery
title: DOM Manipulation
---

Another class of functions that is often considered difficult to test is code that directly manipulates the DOM. Let's see how we can test the following snippet of jQuery code that listens to a click event, fetches some data asynchronously and sets the content of a span.

```javascript title="displayUser.js"
"use strict";

const $ = require("jquery");
const fetchCurrentUser = require("./fetchCurrentUser.js");

$("#button").click(() => {
  fetchCurrentUser((user) => {
    const loggedText = "Logged " + (user.loggedIn ? "In" : "Out");
    $("#username").text(user.fullName + " - " + loggedText);
  });
});
```

Again, we create a test file in the `__tests__/` folder:

```javascript title="__tests__/displayUser-test.js"
"use strict";

jest.mock("../fetchCurrentUser");

test("displays a user after a click", () => {
  // Set up our document body
  document.body.innerHTML =
    "<div>" +
    '  <span id="username" />' +
    '  <button id="button" />' +
    "</div>";

  // This module has a side-effect
  require("../displayUser");

  const $ = require("jquery");
  const fetchCurrentUser = require("../fetchCurrentUser");

  // Tell the fetchCurrentUser mock function to automatically invoke
  // its callback with some data
  fetchCurrentUser.mockImplementation((cb) => {
    cb({
      fullName: "Johnny Cash",
      loggedIn: true,
    });
  });

  // Use jquery to emulate a click on our button
  $("#button").click();

  // Assert that the fetchCurrentUser function was called, and that the
  // #username span's inner text was updated as we'd expect it to.
  expect(fetchCurrentUser).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect($("#username").text()).toBe("Johnny Cash - Logged In");
});
```

We are mocking `fetchCurrentUser.js` so that our test doesn't make a real network request but instead resolves to mock data locally. This ensures that our test can complete in milliseconds rather than seconds and guarantees a fast unit test iteration speed.

Also, the function being tested adds an event listener on the `#button` DOM element, so we need to set up our DOM correctly for the test. `jsdom` and the `jest-environment-jsdom` package simulate a DOM environment as if you were in the browser. This means that every DOM API that we call can be observed in the same way it would be observed in a browser!

To get started with the JSDOM [test environment](Configuration.md#testenvironment-string), the `jest-environment-jsdom` package must be installed if it's not already:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom
```

The code for this example is available at [examples/jquery](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/examples/jquery).

## File: docs/TutorialReact.md

````markdown
---
id: tutorial-react
title: Testing React Apps
---

At Facebook, we use Jest to test [React](https://reactjs.org/) applications.

## Setup

### Setup with Create React App

If you are new to React, we recommend using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). It is ready to use and [ships with Jest](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/#docsNav)! You will only need to add `react-test-renderer` for rendering snapshots.

Run

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev react-test-renderer
```

### Setup without Create React App

If you have an existing application you'll need to install a few packages to make everything work well together. We are using the `babel-jest` package and the `react` babel preset to transform our code inside of the test environment. Also see [using babel](GettingStarted.md#using-babel).

Run

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react react-test-renderer
```

Your `package.json` should look something like this (where `<current-version>` is the actual latest version number for the package). Please add the scripts and jest configuration entries:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "<current-version>",
    "react-dom": "<current-version>"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/preset-env": "<current-version>",
    "@babel/preset-react": "<current-version>",
    "babel-jest": "<current-version>",
    "jest": "<current-version>",
    "react-test-renderer": "<current-version>"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

```js title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    "@babel/preset-env",
    ["@babel/preset-react", { runtime: "automatic" }],
  ],
};
```

**And you're good to go!**

### Snapshot Testing

Let's create a [snapshot test](SnapshotTesting.md) for a Link component that renders hyperlinks:

```tsx title="Link.js"
import { useState } from "react";

const STATUS = {
  HOVERED: "hovered",
  NORMAL: "normal",
};

export default function Link({ page, children }) {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState(STATUS.NORMAL);

  const onMouseEnter = () => {
    setStatus(STATUS.HOVERED);
  };

  const onMouseLeave = () => {
    setStatus(STATUS.NORMAL);
  };

  return (
    <a
      className={status}
      href={page || "#"}
      onMouseEnter={onMouseEnter}
      onMouseLeave={onMouseLeave}
    >
      {children}
    </a>
  );
}
```

:::note

Examples are using Function components, but Class components can be tested in the same way. See [React: Function and Class Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components). **Reminders** that with Class components, we expect Jest to be used to test props and not methods directly.

:::

Now let's use React's test renderer and Jest's snapshot feature to interact with the component and capture the rendered output and create a snapshot file:

```tsx title="Link.test.js"
import renderer from "react-test-renderer";
import Link from "../Link";

it("changes the class when hovered", () => {
  const component = renderer.create(
    <Link page="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</Link>
  );
  let tree = component.toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();

  // manually trigger the callback
  renderer.act(() => {
    tree.props.onMouseEnter();
  });
  // re-rendering
  tree = component.toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();

  // manually trigger the callback
  renderer.act(() => {
    tree.props.onMouseLeave();
  });
  // re-rendering
  tree = component.toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

When you run `yarn test` or `jest`, this will produce an output file like this:

```javascript title="__tests__/__snapshots__/Link.test.js.snap"
exports[`changes the class when hovered 1`] = `
<a
  className="normal"
  href="http://www.facebook.com"
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`;

exports[`changes the class when hovered 2`] = `
<a
  className="hovered"
  href="http://www.facebook.com"
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`;

exports[`changes the class when hovered 3`] = `
<a
  className="normal"
  href="http://www.facebook.com"
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`;
```

The next time you run the tests, the rendered output will be compared to the previously created snapshot. The snapshot should be committed along with code changes. When a snapshot test fails, you need to inspect whether it is an intended or unintended change. If the change is expected you can invoke Jest with `jest -u` to overwrite the existing snapshot.

The code for this example is available at [examples/snapshot](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/examples/snapshot).

#### Snapshot Testing with Mocks, Enzyme and React 16+

There's a caveat around snapshot testing when using Enzyme and React 16+. If you mock out a module using the following style:

```js
jest.mock("../SomeDirectory/SomeComponent", () => "SomeComponent");
```

Then you will see warnings in the console:

```bash
Warning: <SomeComponent /> is using uppercase HTML. Always use lowercase HTML tags in React.

# Or:
Warning: The tag <SomeComponent> is unrecognized in this browser. If you meant to render a React component, start its name with an uppercase letter.
```

React 16 triggers these warnings due to how it checks element types, and the mocked module fails these checks. Your options are:

1.  Render as text. This way you won't see the props passed to the mock component in the snapshot, but it's straightforward:
    ```js
    jest.mock("./SomeComponent", () => () => "SomeComponent");
    ```
2.  Render as a custom element. DOM "custom elements" aren't checked for anything and shouldn't fire warnings. They are lowercase and have a dash in the name.
    ```tsx
    jest.mock("./Widget", () => () => <mock-widget />);
    ```
3.  Use `react-test-renderer`. The test renderer doesn't care about element types and will happily accept e.g. `SomeComponent`. You could check snapshots using the test renderer, and check component behavior separately using Enzyme.
4.  Disable warnings all together (should be done in your jest setup file):
    ```js
    jest.mock("fbjs/lib/warning", () => require("fbjs/lib/emptyFunction"));
    ```
    This shouldn't normally be your option of choice as useful warnings could be lost. However, in some cases, for example when testing react-native's components we are rendering react-native tags into the DOM and many warnings are irrelevant. Another option is to swizzle the console.warn and suppress specific warnings.

### DOM Testing

If you'd like to assert, and manipulate your rendered components you can use [@testing-library/react](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library), [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/), or React's [TestUtils](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html). The following example use `@testing-library/react`.

#### @testing-library/react

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react
```

Let's implement a checkbox which swaps between two labels:

```tsx title="CheckboxWithLabel.js"
import { useState } from "react";

export default function CheckboxWithLabel({ labelOn, labelOff }) {
  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);

  const onChange = () => {
    setIsChecked(!isChecked);
  };

  return (
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" checked={isChecked} onChange={onChange} />
      {isChecked ? labelOn : labelOff}
    </label>
  );
}
```

```tsx title="__tests__/CheckboxWithLabel-test.js"
import { cleanup, fireEvent, render } from "@testing-library/react";
import CheckboxWithLabel from "../CheckboxWithLabel";

// Note: running cleanup afterEach is done automatically for you in @testing-library/react@9.0.0 or higher
// unmount and cleanup DOM after the test is finished.
afterEach(cleanup);

it("CheckboxWithLabel changes the text after click", () => {
  const { queryByLabelText, getByLabelText } = render(
    <CheckboxWithLabel labelOn="On" labelOff="Off" />
  );

  expect(queryByLabelText(/off/i)).toBeTruthy();

  fireEvent.click(getByLabelText(/off/i));

  expect(queryByLabelText(/on/i)).toBeTruthy();
});
```

The code for this example is available at [examples/react-testing-library](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/examples/react-testing-library).

### Custom transformers

If you need more advanced functionality, you can also build your own transformer. Instead of using `babel-jest`, here is an example of using `@babel/core`:

```javascript title="custom-transformer.js"
"use strict";

const { transform } = require("@babel/core");
const jestPreset = require("babel-preset-jest");

module.exports = {
  process(src, filename) {
    const result = transform(src, {
      filename,
      presets: [jestPreset],
    });

    return result || src;
  },
};
```

Don't forget to install the `@babel/core` and `babel-preset-jest` packages for this example to work.

To make this work with Jest you need to update your Jest configuration with this: `"transform": {"\\.js$": "path/to/custom-transformer.js"}`.

If you'd like to build a transformer with babel support, you can also use `babel-jest` to compose one and pass in your custom configuration options:

```javascript
const babelJest = require("babel-jest");

module.exports = babelJest.createTransformer({
  presets: ["my-custom-preset"],
});
```

See [dedicated docs](CodeTransformation.md#writing-custom-transformers) for more details.

title: Testing React Native Apps
---

At Facebook, we use Jest to test [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) applications.

Get a deeper insight into testing a working React Native app example by reading the following series: [Part 1: Jest – Snapshot come into play](https://callstack.com/blog/testing-react-native-with-the-new-jest-part-1-snapshots-come-into-play/) and [Part 2: Jest – Redux Snapshots for your Actions and Reducers](https://callstack.com/blog/testing-react-native-with-the-new-jest-part-2-redux-snapshots-for-your-actions-and-reducers/).

## Setup

Starting from react-native version 0.38, a Jest setup is included by default when running `react-native init`. The following configuration should be automatically added to your package.json file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "jest": {
    "preset": "react-native"
  }
}
```

Run `yarn test` to run tests with Jest.

:::tip

If you are upgrading your react-native application and previously used the `jest-react-native` preset, remove the dependency from your `package.json` file and change the preset to `react-native` instead.

:::

## Snapshot Test

Let's create a [snapshot test](SnapshotTesting.md) for a small intro component with a few views and text components and some styles:

```tsx title="Intro.js"
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";

class Intro extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.welcome}>Welcome to React Native!</Text>
        <Text style={styles.instructions}>
          This is a React Native snapshot test.
        </Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    alignItems: "center",
    backgroundColor: "#F5FCFF",
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: "center",
  },
  instructions: {
    color: "#333333",
    marginBottom: 5,
    textAlign: "center",
  },
  welcome: {
    fontSize: 20,
    margin: 10,
    textAlign: "center",
  },
});

export default Intro;
```

Now let's use React's test renderer and Jest's snapshot feature to interact with the component and capture the rendered output and create a snapshot file:

```tsx title="__tests__/Intro-test.js"
import React from "react";
import renderer from "react-test-renderer";
import Intro from "../Intro";

test("renders correctly", () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<Intro />).toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

When you run `yarn test` or `jest`, this will produce an output file like this:

```javascript title="__tests__/__snapshots__/Intro-test.js.snap"
exports[`Intro renders correctly 1`] = `
<View
  style={
    Object {
      "alignItems": "center",
      "backgroundColor": "#F5FCFF",
      "flex": 1,
      "justifyContent": "center",
    }
  }>
  <Text
    style={
      Object {
        "fontSize": 20,
        "margin": 10,
        "textAlign": "center",
      }
    }>
    Welcome to React Native!
  </Text>
  <Text
    style={
      Object {
        "color": "#333333",
        "marginBottom": 5,
        "textAlign": "center",
      }
    }>
    This is a React Native snapshot test.
  </Text>
</View>
`;
```

The next time you run the tests, the rendered output will be compared to the previously created snapshot. The snapshot should be committed along with code changes. When a snapshot test fails, you need to inspect whether it is an intended or unintended change. If the change is expected you can invoke Jest with `jest -u` to overwrite the existing snapshot.

The code for this example is available at [examples/react-native](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/examples/react-native).

## Preset configuration

The preset sets up the environment and is very opinionated and based on what we found to be useful at Facebook. All of the configuration options can be overwritten just as they can be customized when no preset is used.

### Environment

`react-native` ships with a Jest preset, so the `jest.preset` field of your `package.json` should point to `react-native`. The preset is a node environment that mimics the environment of a React Native app. Because it doesn't load any DOM or browser APIs, it greatly improves Jest's startup time.

### transformIgnorePatterns customization

The [`transformIgnorePatterns`](configuration#transformignorepatterns-arraystring) option can be used to specify which files shall be transformed by Babel. Many `react-native` npm modules unfortunately don't pre-compile their source code before publishing.

By default the `jest-react-native` preset only processes the project's own source files and `react-native`. If you have npm dependencies that have to be transformed you can customize this configuration option by including modules other than `react-native` by grouping them and separating them with the `|` operator:

```json
{
  "transformIgnorePatterns": [
    "node_modules/(?!(react-native|my-project|react-native-button)/)"
  ]
}
```

You can test which paths would match (and thus be excluded from transformation) with a tool [like this](https://regex101.com/r/JsLIDM/1).

`transformIgnorePatterns` will exclude a file from transformation if the path matches against **any** pattern provided. Splitting into multiple patterns could therefore have unintended results if you are not careful. In the example below, the exclusion (also known as a negative lookahead assertion) for `foo` and `bar` cancel each other out:

```json
{
  "transformIgnorePatterns": ["node_modules/(?!foo/)", "node_modules/(?!bar/)"] // not what you want
}
```

### setupFiles

If you'd like to provide additional configuration for every test file, the [`setupFiles` configuration option](configuration#setupfiles-array) can be used to specify setup scripts.

### moduleNameMapper

The [`moduleNameMapper`](configuration#modulenamemapper-objectstring-string--arraystring) can be used to map a module path to a different module. By default the preset maps all images to an image stub module but if a module cannot be found this configuration option can help:

```json
{
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "my-module.js": "<rootDir>/path/to/my-module.js"
  }
}
```

## Tips

### Mock native modules using jest.mock

The Jest preset built into `react-native` comes with a few default mocks that are applied on a react-native repository. However, some react-native components or third party components rely on native code to be rendered. In such cases, Jest's manual mocking system can help to mock out the underlying implementation.

For example, if your code depends on a third party native video component called `react-native-video` you might want to stub it out with a manual mock like this:

```js
jest.mock("react-native-video", () => "Video");
```

This will render the component as `<Video {...props} />` with all of its props in the snapshot output. See also [caveats around Enzyme and React 16](tutorial-react#snapshot-testing-with-mocks-enzyme-and-react-16).

Sometimes you need to provide a more complex manual mock. For example if you'd like to forward the prop types or static fields of a native component to a mock, you can return a different React component from a mock through this helper from jest-react-native:

```js
jest.mock("path/to/MyNativeComponent", () => {
  const mockComponent = require("react-native/jest/mockComponent");
  return mockComponent("path/to/MyNativeComponent");
});
```

Or if you'd like to create your own manual mock, you can do something like this:

```js
jest.mock("Text", () => {
  const RealComponent = jest.requireActual("Text");
  const React = require("react");
  class Text extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return React.createElement("Text", this.props, this.props.children);
    }
  }
  Text.propTypes = RealComponent.propTypes;
  return Text;
});
```

In other cases you may want to mock a native module that isn't a React component. The same technique can be applied. We recommend inspecting the native module's source code and logging the module when running a react native app on a real device and then modeling a manual mock after the real module.

If you end up mocking the same modules over and over it is recommended to define these mocks in a separate file and add it to the list of `setupFiles`.

## File: docs/UpgradingToJest29.md

````markdown
---
id: upgrading-to-jest29
title: From v28 to v29
---

Upgrading Jest from v28 to v29? This guide aims to help refactoring your configuration and tests.

:::info

See [changelog](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2900) for the full list of changes.

:::

:::note

Upgrading from an older version? You can see the upgrade guide from v27 to v28 [here](/docs/28.x/upgrading-to-jest28).

:::

## Compatibility

The supported Node versions are 14.15, 16.10, 18.0 and above.

## Snapshot format

As announced in the [Jest 28 blog post](/blog/2022/04/25/jest-28#future), Jest 29 has changed the default snapshot formatting to `{escapeString: false, printBasicPrototype: false}`.

If you want to keep the old behavior, you can set the `snapshotFormat` property to:

```diff
+ snapshotFormat: {
+   escapeString: true,
+   printBasicPrototype: true
+ }
```

## JSDOM upgrade

`jest-environment-jsdom` has upgraded `jsdom` from v19 to v20.

:::info

If you use `jest-environment-jsdom`, the minimum TypeScript version is set to `4.5`.

:::

Notably, `jsdom@20` includes support for `crypto.getRandomValues()`, which means packages like `uuid` and `nanoid`, which doesn't work properly in Jest@28, can work without extra polyfills.

## `pretty-format`

`ConvertAnsi` plugin is removed from `pretty-format` package in favour of [`jest-serializer-ansi-escapes`](https://github.com/mrazauskas/jest-serializer-ansi-escapes).

### `jest-mock`

Exports of `Mocked*` utility types from `jest-mock` package have changed. `MaybeMockedDeep` and `MaybeMocked` now are exported as `Mocked` and `MockedShallow` respectively; only deep mocked variants of `MockedClass`, `MockedFunction` and `MockedObject` are exposed.

## TypeScript

import TypeScriptExamplesNote from './\_TypeScriptExamplesNote.md';

<TypeScriptExamplesNote />

### `jest.mocked()`

The [`jest.mocked()`](MockFunctionAPI.md#jestmockedsource-options) helper method now wraps types of deep members of passed object by default. If you have used the method with `true` as the second argument, remove it to avoid type errors:

```diff
- const mockedObject = jest.mocked(someObject, true);
+ const mockedObject = jest.mocked(someObject);
```

To have the old shallow mocked behavior, pass `{shallow: true}` as the second argument:

```diff
- const mockedObject = jest.mocked(someObject);
+ const mockedObject = jest.mocked(someObject, {shallow: true});
```

## File: docs/UsingMatchers.md

````markdown
---
id: using-matchers
title: Using Matchers
---

Jest uses "matchers" to let you test values in different ways. This document will introduce some commonly used matchers. For the full list, see the [`expect` API doc](ExpectAPI.md).

## Common Matchers

The simplest way to test a value is with exact equality.

```js
test("two plus two is four", () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
});
```

In this code, `expect(2 + 2)` returns an "expectation" object. You typically won't do much with these expectation objects except call matchers on them. In this code, `.toBe(4)` is the matcher. When Jest runs, it tracks all the failing matchers so that it can print out nice error messages for you.

`toBe` uses `Object.is` to test exact equality. If you want to check the value of an object, use `toEqual`:

```js
test("object assignment", () => {
  const data = { one: 1 };
  data["two"] = 2;
  expect(data).toEqual({ one: 1, two: 2 });
});
```

`toEqual` recursively checks every field of an object or array.

:::tip

`toEqual` ignores object keys with `undefined` properties, `undefined` array items, array sparseness, or object type mismatch. To take these into account use `toStrictEqual` instead.

:::

You can also test for the opposite of a matcher using `not`:

```js
test("adding positive numbers is not zero", () => {
  for (let a = 1; a < 10; a++) {
    for (let b = 1; b < 10; b++) {
      expect(a + b).not.toBe(0);
    }
  }
});
```

## Truthiness

In tests, you sometimes need to distinguish between `undefined`, `null`, and `false`, but you sometimes do not want to treat these differently. Jest contains helpers that let you be explicit about what you want.

- `toBeNull` matches only `null`
- `toBeUndefined` matches only `undefined`
- `toBeDefined` is the opposite of `toBeUndefined`
- `toBeTruthy` matches anything that an `if` statement treats as true
- `toBeFalsy` matches anything that an `if` statement treats as false

For example:

```js
test("null", () => {
  const n = null;
  expect(n).toBeNull();
  expect(n).toBeDefined();
  expect(n).not.toBeUndefined();
  expect(n).not.toBeTruthy();
  expect(n).toBeFalsy();
});

test("zero", () => {
  const z = 0;
  expect(z).not.toBeNull();
  expect(z).toBeDefined();
  expect(z).not.toBeUndefined();
  expect(z).not.toBeTruthy();
  expect(z).toBeFalsy();
});
```

You should use the matcher that most precisely corresponds to what you want your code to be doing.

## Numbers

Most ways of comparing numbers have matcher equivalents.

```js
test("two plus two", () => {
  const value = 2 + 2;
  expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(3);
  expect(value).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(3.5);
  expect(value).toBeLessThan(5);
  expect(value).toBeLessThanOrEqual(4.5);

  // toBe and toEqual are equivalent for numbers
  expect(value).toBe(4);
  expect(value).toEqual(4);
});
```

For floating point equality, use `toBeCloseTo` instead of `toEqual`, because you don't want a test to depend on a tiny rounding error.

```js
test("adding floating point numbers", () => {
  const value = 0.1 + 0.2;
  //expect(value).toBe(0.3);           This won't work because of rounding error
  expect(value).toBeCloseTo(0.3); // This works.
});
```

## Strings

You can check strings against regular expressions with `toMatch`:

```js
test("there is no I in team", () => {
  expect("team").not.toMatch(/I/);
});

test('but there is a "stop" in Christoph', () => {
  expect("Christoph").toMatch(/stop/);
});
```

## Arrays and iterables

You can check if an array or iterable contains a particular item using `toContain`:

```js
const shoppingList = [
  "diapers",
  "kleenex",
  "trash bags",
  "paper towels",
  "milk",
];

test("the shopping list has milk on it", () => {
  expect(shoppingList).toContain("milk");
  expect(new Set(shoppingList)).toContain("milk");
});
```

## Exceptions

If you want to test whether a particular function throws an error when it's called, use `toThrow`.

```js
function compileAndroidCode() {
  throw new Error("you are using the wrong JDK!");
}

test("compiling android goes as expected", () => {
  expect(() => compileAndroidCode()).toThrow();
  expect(() => compileAndroidCode()).toThrow(Error);

  // You can also use a string that must be contained in the error message or a regexp
  expect(() => compileAndroidCode()).toThrow("you are using the wrong JDK");
  expect(() => compileAndroidCode()).toThrow(/JDK/);

  // Or you can match an exact error message using a regexp like below
  expect(() => compileAndroidCode()).toThrow(/^you are using the wrong JDK$/); // Test fails
  expect(() => compileAndroidCode()).toThrow(/^you are using the wrong JDK!$/); // Test pass
});
```

:::tip

The function that throws an exception needs to be invoked within a wrapping function otherwise the `toThrow` assertion will fail.

:::

## And More

This is just a taste. For a complete list of matchers, check out the [reference docs](ExpectAPI.md).

Once you've learned about the matchers that are available, a good next step is to check out how Jest lets you [test asynchronous code](TestingAsyncCode.md).

## File: docs/WatchPlugins.md

````markdown
---
id: watch-plugins
title: Watch Plugins
---

The Jest watch plugin system provides a way to hook into specific parts of Jest and to define watch mode menu prompts that execute code on key press. Combined, these features allow you to develop interactive experiences custom for your workflow.

## Watch Plugin Interface

```javascript
class MyWatchPlugin {
  // Add hooks to Jest lifecycle events
  apply(jestHooks) {}

  // Get the prompt information for interactive plugins
  getUsageInfo(globalConfig) {}

  // Executed when the key from `getUsageInfo` is input
  run(globalConfig, updateConfigAndRun) {}
}
```

## Hooking into Jest

To connect your watch plugin to Jest, add its path under `watchPlugins` in your Jest configuration:

```javascript title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  watchPlugins: ["path/to/yourWatchPlugin"],
};
```

Custom watch plugins can add hooks to Jest events. These hooks can be added either with or without having an interactive key in the watch mode menu.

### `apply(jestHooks)`

Jest hooks can be attached by implementing the `apply` method. This method receives a `jestHooks` argument that allows the plugin to hook into specific parts of the lifecycle of a test run.

```javascript
class MyWatchPlugin {
  apply(jestHooks) {}
}
```

Below are the hooks available in Jest.

#### `jestHooks.shouldRunTestSuite(testSuiteInfo)`

Returns a boolean (or `Promise<boolean>` for handling asynchronous operations) to specify if a test should be run or not.

For example:

```javascript
class MyWatchPlugin {
  apply(jestHooks) {
    jestHooks.shouldRunTestSuite((testSuiteInfo) => {
      return testSuiteInfo.testPath.includes("my-keyword");
    });

    // or a promise
    jestHooks.shouldRunTestSuite((testSuiteInfo) => {
      return Promise.resolve(testSuiteInfo.testPath.includes("my-keyword"));
    });
  }
}
```

#### `jestHooks.onTestRunComplete(results)`

Gets called at the end of every test run. It has the test results as an argument.

For example:

```javascript
class MyWatchPlugin {
  apply(jestHooks) {
    jestHooks.onTestRunComplete((results) => {
      this._hasSnapshotFailure = results.snapshot.failure;
    });
  }
}
```

#### `jestHooks.onFileChange({projects})`

Gets called whenever there is a change in the file system

- `projects: Array<config: ProjectConfig, testPaths: Array<string>`: Includes all the test paths that Jest is watching.

For example:

```javascript
class MyWatchPlugin {
  apply(jestHooks) {
    jestHooks.onFileChange(({ projects }) => {
      this._projects = projects;
    });
  }
}
```

## Watch Menu Integration

Custom watch plugins can also add or override functionality to the watch menu by specifying a key/prompt pair in `getUsageInfo` method and a `run` method for the execution of the key.

### `getUsageInfo(globalConfig)`

To add a key to the watch menu, implement the `getUsageInfo` method, returning a key and the prompt:

```javascript
class MyWatchPlugin {
  getUsageInfo(globalConfig) {
    return {
      key: "s",
      prompt: "do something",
    };
  }
}
```

This will add a line in the watch mode menu _(`› Press s to do something.`)_

```text
Watch Usage
 › Press p to filter by a filename regex pattern.
 › Press t to filter by a test name regex pattern.
 › Press q to quit watch mode.
 › Press s to do something. // <-- This is our plugin
 › Press Enter to trigger a test run.
```

:::note

If the key for your plugin already exists as a default key, your plugin will override that key.

:::

### `run(globalConfig, updateConfigAndRun)`

To handle key press events from the key returned by `getUsageInfo`, you can implement the `run` method. This method returns a `Promise<boolean>` that can be resolved when the plugin wants to return control to Jest. The `boolean` specifies if Jest should rerun the tests after it gets the control back.

- [`globalConfig`](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/blob/v29.2.1/packages/jest-types/src/Config.ts#L358-L422): A representation of Jest's current global configuration
- `updateConfigAndRun`: Allows you to trigger a test run while the interactive plugin is running.

```javascript
class MyWatchPlugin {
  run(globalConfig, updateConfigAndRun) {
    // do something.
  }
}
```

:::note

If you do call `updateConfigAndRun`, your `run` method should not resolve to a truthy value, as that would trigger a double-run.

:::

#### Authorized configuration keys

For stability and safety reasons, only part of the global configuration keys can be updated with `updateConfigAndRun`. The current white list is as follows:

- [`bail`](configuration#bail-number--boolean)
- [`changedSince`](cli#--changedsince)
- [`collectCoverage`](configuration#collectcoverage-boolean)
- [`collectCoverageFrom`](configuration#collectcoveragefrom-array)
- [`coverageDirectory`](configuration#coveragedirectory-string)
- [`coverageReporters`](configuration#coveragereporters-arraystring)
- [`notify`](configuration#notify-boolean)
- [`notifyMode`](configuration#notifymode-string)
- [`onlyFailures`](configuration#onlyfailures-boolean)
- [`reporters`](configuration#reporters-arraymodulename--modulename-options)
- [`testNamePattern`](cli#--testnamepatternregex)
- [`testPathPatterns`](cli#--testpathpatternsregex)
- [`updateSnapshot`](cli#--updatesnapshot)
- [`verbose`](configuration#verbose-boolean)

## Customization

Plugins can be customized via your Jest configuration.

```javascript title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  watchPlugins: [
    [
      "path/to/yourWatchPlugin",
      {
        key: "k", // <- your custom key
        prompt: "show a custom prompt",
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

Recommended config names:

- `key`: Modifies the plugin key.
- `prompt`: Allows user to customize the text in the plugin prompt.

If the user provided a custom configuration, it will be passed as an argument to the plugin constructor.

```javascript
class MyWatchPlugin {
  constructor({ config }) {}
}
```

## Choosing a good key

Jest allows third-party plugins to override some of its built-in feature keys, but not all. Specifically, the following keys are **not overwritable** :

- `c` (clears filter patterns)
- `i` (updates non-matching snapshots interactively)
- `q` (quits)
- `u` (updates all non-matching snapshots)
- `w` (displays watch mode usage / available actions)

The following keys for built-in functionality **can be overwritten** :

- `p` (test filename pattern)
- `t` (test name pattern)

Any key not used by built-in functionality can be claimed, as you would expect. Try to avoid using keys that are difficult to obtain on various keyboards (e.g. `é`, `€`), or not visible by default (e.g. many Mac keyboards do not have visual hints for characters such as `|`, `\`, `[`, etc.)

### When a conflict happens

Should your plugin attempt to overwrite a reserved key, Jest will error out with a descriptive message, something like:

```bash

Watch plugin YourFaultyPlugin attempted to register key `q`, that is reserved internally for quitting watch mode. Please change the configuration key for this plugin.

```

Third-party plugins are also forbidden to overwrite a key reserved already by another third-party plugin present earlier in the configured plugins list (`watchPlugins` array setting). When this happens, you’ll also get an error message that tries to help you fix that:

```bash

Watch plugins YourFaultyPlugin and TheirFaultyPlugin both attempted to register key `x`. Please change the key configuration for one of the conflicting plugins to avoid overlap.

```

## File: docs/Webpack.md

````markdown
---
id: webpack
title: Using with webpack
---

Jest can be used in projects that use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to manage assets, styles, and compilation. webpack _does_ offer some unique challenges over other tools because it integrates directly with your application to allow managing stylesheets, assets like images and fonts, along with the expansive ecosystem of compile-to-JavaScript languages and tools.

## A webpack example

Let's start with a common sort of webpack config file and translate it to a Jest setup.

```js title="webpack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        exclude: ["node_modules"],
        use: ["babel-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.gif$/,
        type: "asset/inline",
      },
      {
        test: /\.(ttf|eot|svg)$/,
        type: "asset/resource",
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      config$: "./configs/app-config.js",
      react: "./vendor/react-master",
    },
    extensions: [".js", ".jsx"],
    modules: [
      "node_modules",
      "bower_components",
      "shared",
      "/shared/vendor/modules",
    ],
  },
};
```

If you have JavaScript files that are transformed by Babel, you can [enable support for Babel](GettingStarted.md#using-babel) by installing the `babel-jest` plugin. Non-Babel JavaScript transformations can be handled with Jest's [`transform`](Configuration.md#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object) config option.

### Handling Static Assets

Next, let's configure Jest to gracefully handle asset files such as stylesheets and images. Usually, these files aren't particularly useful in tests so we can safely mock them out. However, if you are using CSS Modules then it's better to mock a proxy for your className lookups.

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|eot|otf|webp|svg|ttf|woff|woff2|mp4|webm|wav|mp3|m4a|aac|oga)$":
      "<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js",
    "\\.(css|less)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/styleMock.js",
  },
};
```

And the mock files themselves:

```js title="__mocks__/styleMock.js"
module.exports = {};
```

```js title="__mocks__/fileMock.js"
module.exports = "test-file-stub";
```

### Mocking CSS Modules

You can use an [ES6 Proxy](https://github.com/keyanzhang/identity-obj-proxy) to mock [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules):

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev identity-obj-proxy
```

Then all your className lookups on the styles object will be returned as-is (e.g., `styles.foobar === 'foobar'`). This is pretty handy for React [Snapshot Testing](SnapshotTesting.md).

```js title="jest.config.js (for CSS Modules)"
module.exports = {
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|eot|otf|webp|svg|ttf|woff|woff2|mp4|webm|wav|mp3|m4a|aac|oga)$":
      "<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js",
    "\\.(css|less)$": "identity-obj-proxy",
  },
};
```

If `moduleNameMapper` cannot fulfill your requirements, you can use Jest's [`transform`](Configuration.md#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object) config option to specify how assets are transformed. For example, a transformer that returns the basename of a file (such that `require('logo.jpg');` returns `'logo'`) can be written as:

```js title="fileTransformer.js"
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  process(sourceText, sourcePath, options) {
    return {
      code: `module.exports = ${JSON.stringify(path.basename(sourcePath))};`,
    };
  },
};
```

```js title="jest.config.js (for custom transformers and CSS Modules)"
module.exports = {
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "\\.(css|less)$": "identity-obj-proxy",
  },
  transform: {
    "\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|eot|otf|webp|svg|ttf|woff|woff2|mp4|webm|wav|mp3|m4a|aac|oga)$":
      "<rootDir>/fileTransformer.js",
  },
};
```

We've told Jest to ignore files matching a stylesheet or image extension, and instead, require our mock files. You can adjust the regular expression to match the file types your webpack config handles.

:::tip

Remember to include the default `babel-jest` transformer explicitly, if you wish to use it alongside with additional code preprocessors:

```json
"transform": {
  "\\.[jt]sx?$": "babel-jest",
  "\\.css$": "some-css-transformer",
}
```

:::

### Configuring Jest to find our files

Now that Jest knows how to process our files, we need to tell it how to _find_ them. For webpack's `modules`, and `extensions` options there are direct analogs in Jest's `moduleDirectories` and `moduleFileExtensions` options.

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  moduleFileExtensions: ["js", "jsx"],
  moduleDirectories: ["node_modules", "bower_components", "shared"],

  moduleNameMapper: {
    "\\.(css|less)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/styleMock.js",
    "\\.(gif|ttf|eot|svg)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js",
  },
};
```

:::note

`<rootDir>` is a special token that gets replaced by Jest with the root of your project. Most of the time this will be the folder where your `package.json` is located unless you specify a custom [`rootDir`](Configuration.md#rootdir-string) option in your configuration.

:::

Similarly, Jest's counterpart for Webpack's `resolve.roots` (an alternative to setting `NODE_PATH`) is `modulePaths`.

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  modulePaths: ["/shared/vendor/modules"],
  moduleFileExtensions: ["js", "jsx"],
  moduleDirectories: ["node_modules", "bower_components", "shared"],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "\\.(css|less)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/styleMock.js",
    "\\.(gif|ttf|eot|svg)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js",
  },
};
```

And finally, we have to handle the webpack `alias`. For that, we can make use of the `moduleNameMapper` option again.

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  modulePaths: ["/shared/vendor/modules"],
  moduleFileExtensions: ["js", "jsx"],
  moduleDirectories: ["node_modules", "bower_components", "shared"],

  moduleNameMapper: {
    "\\.(css|less)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/styleMock.js",
    "\\.(gif|ttf|eot|svg)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js",

    "^react(.*)$": "<rootDir>/vendor/react-master$1",
    "^config$": "<rootDir>/configs/app-config.js",
  },
};
```

That's it! webpack is a complex and flexible tool, so you may have to make some adjustments to handle your specific application's needs. Luckily for most projects, Jest should be more than flexible enough to handle your webpack config.

:::tip

For more complex webpack configurations, you may also want to investigate projects such as: [babel-plugin-webpack-loaders](https://github.com/istarkov/babel-plugin-webpack-loaders).

:::

## Using with webpack

In addition to installing `babel-jest` as described earlier, you'll need to add `@babel/preset-env` like so:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env
```

Then, you'll want to configure Babel as follows:

```json title=".babelrc"
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

:::tip

Jest caches files to speed up test execution. If you updated `.babelrc` and Jest is not working as expected, try clearing the cache by running `jest --clearCache`.

:::

:::tip

If you use dynamic imports (`import('some-file.js').then(module => ...)`), you need to enable the `dynamic-import-node` plugin.

```json title=".babelrc"
{
  "presets": [["env", { "modules": false }]],

  "plugins": ["syntax-dynamic-import"],

  "env": {
    "test": {
      "plugins": ["dynamic-import-node"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

<!-- copied from Getting Started docs, links updated to point to Jest website -->

Install Jest using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest):

```bash
yarn add --dev jest
```

Or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest):

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Note: Jest documentation uses `yarn` commands, but `npm` will also work. You can compare `yarn` and `npm` commands in the [yarn docs, here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm#toc-cli-commands-comparison).

Let's get started by writing a test for a hypothetical function that adds two numbers. First, create a `sum.js` file:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;
```

Then, create a file named `sum.test.js`. This will contain our actual test:

```javascript
const sum = require("./sum");

test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

Add the following section to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Finally, run `yarn test` or `npm test` and Jest will print this message:

```bash
PASS  ./sum.test.js
✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (5ms)
```

**You just successfully wrote your first test using Jest!**

This test used `expect` and `toBe` to test that two values were exactly identical. To learn about the other things that Jest can test, see [Using Matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers).

## Running from command line

You can run Jest directly from the CLI (if it's globally available in your `PATH`, e.g. by `yarn global add jest` or `npm install jest --global`) with a variety of useful options.

Here's how to run Jest on files matching `my-test`, using `config.json` as a configuration file and display a native OS notification after the run:

```bash
jest my-test --notify --config=config.json
```

If you'd like to learn more about running `jest` through the command line, take a look at the [Jest CLI Options](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli) page.

## Additional Configuration

### Generate a basic configuration file

Based on your project, Jest will ask you a few questions and will create a basic configuration file with a short description for each option:

```bash
yarn create jest
```

### Using Babel

To use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), install required dependencies via `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add --dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

Configure Babel to target your current version of Node by creating a `babel.config.js` file in the root of your project:

```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [["@babel/preset-env", { targets: { node: "current" } }]],
};
```

The ideal configuration for Babel will depend on your project. See [Babel's docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) for more details.

<details>
  <summary markdown="span"><strong>Making your Babel config jest-aware</strong></summary>

Jest will set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `'test'` if it's not set to something else. You can use that in your configuration to conditionally setup only the compilation needed for Jest, e.g.

```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = (api) => {
  const isTest = api.env("test");
  // You can use isTest to determine what presets and plugins to use.

  return {
    // ...
  };
};
```

> Note: `babel-jest` is automatically installed when installing Jest and will automatically transform files if a babel configuration exists in your project. To avoid this behavior, you can explicitly reset the `transform` configuration option:

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  transform: {},
};
```

</details>

<!-- Note that the Babel 6 section in the Getting Started was removed -->

### Using webpack

Jest can be used in projects that use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to manage assets, styles, and compilation. webpack does offer some unique challenges over other tools. Refer to the [webpack guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack) to get started.

### Using Vite

Jest can be used in projects that use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to serves source code over native ESM to provide some frontend tooling, vite is an opinionated tool and does offer some out-of-the box workflows. Jest is not fully supported by vite due to how the [plugin system](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/1955#issuecomment-776009094) from vite works, but there is some working examples for first-class jest integration using the `vite-jest`, since this is not fully supported, you might as well read the [limitation of the `vite-jest`](https://github.com/sodatea/vite-jest/tree/main/packages/vite-jest#limitations-and-differences-with-commonjs-tests). Refer to the [vite guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to get started.

### Using Parcel

Jest can be used in projects that use [parcel-bundler](https://parceljs.org/) to manage assets, styles, and compilation similar to webpack. Parcel requires zero configuration. Refer to the official [docs](https://parceljs.org/docs/) to get started.

### Using TypeScript

Jest supports TypeScript, via Babel. First, make sure you followed the instructions on [using Babel](#using-babel) above. Next, install the `@babel/preset-typescript` via `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add --dev @babel/preset-typescript
```

Then add `@babel/preset-typescript` to the list of presets in your `babel.config.js`.

```diff
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ['@babel/preset-env', {targets: {node: 'current'}}],
+    '@babel/preset-typescript',
  ],
};
```

However, there are some [caveats](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript#caveats) to using TypeScript with Babel. Because TypeScript support in Babel is purely transpilation, Jest will not type-check your tests as they are run. If you want that, you can use [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) instead, or just run the TypeScript compiler [tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) separately (or as part of your build process).
